        <description>Tak is a board game from Patrick Rothfussâ€™ bestselling novel, the Wise Manâ€™s Fear. When the book was written, Tak was intriguing but imaginary. Now, Patrick Rothfuss and James Ernest have teamed up to make it real. Introducing Tak: A Beautiful Game. It is an elegant two-player game of perfect strategy, are fined diversion from the court of Vintas:â€œTak is the best sort of game: simple in its rules, complex in its strategy. Bredon beat me handily in all five games we played, but I am proud to say that he never beat me the same way twice.â€�-KvotheTak is a new 2-player strategy game invented by James Ernest and Patrick Rothfuss. It was introduced in Patrick Rothfuss' book The Wise Man's Fear, Day 2 of the Kingkiller Chronicle.Tak is a pure abstract game in the same family as chess, go, and mancala. Our goal was to design a new game with a sense of history; a beautiful game with simple rules and deep strategy.To win a game of TAK, a player must be the first to create a â€œroadâ€� of stones connecting opposite sides of the board.Stones can be laid flat or stood on end. When played flat, they are called â€œflat stones.â€� In this orientation, other stones can be stacked on them. If they are stood on end, they are called â€œstanding stonesâ€� or â€œwalls.â€� Nothing can be stacked atop a standing stone, but these do not count as part of a playerâ€™s road.Depending on the size of the game, players may also have capstones, which can can come in many decorative shapes. Capstones serve as both a flat stone and a wall, and can also flatten standing walls.</description>

During each round, a card drawn from the deck determines what number tile you need to place. With only two copies of each of the ten different of cards in the deck, the farther you go into the deck, the better idea you have of what cards are coming. Use all the information available to you and move quickly to build the display worth the most points.

        <description>Patchwork is a form of needlework that involves sewing together pieces of fabric into a larger design. In the past, it was a way to make use of leftover pieces of cloth to create clothing and quilts.Today, patchwork is a form of art, in which the designers use precious fabrics to create beautiful textiles. The use of uneven pieces of fabric in particular can result in real masterpieces and is therefore being practiced by a large number of textile artists.To create a beautiful quilt, however, requires effort and time, but the available patches just do not want to fit together. So choose your patches carefully and keep a healthy supply of buttons to not only finish your quilt, but to make it better and more beautiful than your opponent's.</description>

        <description>Sometimes you will have the impression that there is nothing but chaos on the board. You line up a few of your pieces and the next thing you notice is that they have changed color! The more pieces on the board, the more difficult it becomes to predict what will happen. But also the more opportunities you have! So do not worry: you will get your chance. Just stay alert, and you will create your own little bit of order in the chaos!</description>

        <description>Publisher VideoA quickstart guide to playing4:31POX: SAVE THE PEOPLEis a new board game challenging 1-4 players to stop the spread of a deadly disease. Not only is the game fun, but through play, players understand group immunity and the need to vaccinate.Many public health groups need to better promote immunizations in order to continue to prevent vaccine preventable diseases. Vaccinations against deadly diseases such as diphtheria, polio, and whooping cough were standard public health measures, and they worked: kids today donâ€™t worry about getting polio, for example. But due to suspicions about vaccines and links to other diseases, more parents are refusing to immunize their children, and this could lead to a national health crisis.Parents mistakenly believe that vaccines arenâ€™t necessary any more, or that children develop immunity to these diseases automatically through time. These myths lead to disaster. Whooping cough is back, for example, for the U.S. has lost what is called â€œherd immunityâ€� to this disease as the percent of vaccinated people is lowering, allowing ways for contagion to spread among the populace.</description>

        <description>The politics of the high court are elegant, shadowy and subtle. Not so in the outlying duchies. Rival dukes contend for unclaimed lands far from the kingâ€™s reach, and possession is the law in these lands. Use your forces to capture enemy troops before you lose the chance to claim the land for yourself.InThe Duke, players move their troop tiles around the board and flip them over after each move. Each tileâ€™s side shows a dierent movement pattern. If you end your movement in a square occupied by an opponentâ€™s tile, you capture it. Capture your opponentâ€™s Duke to win!</description>

        <description>The game of chess is thought to have originated in what is now northern India or Afghanistan sometime before 600 CE: the oldest written references to chess date from then, but there are unverified claims that chess existed as early as 100 CE.Interest in chess followed early trade routes out of India. One variation of chess (called Shogi) is now popular in Japan; another variation is played in China. Many local variations in chess rules persist even today in isolated rural areas, for example in India.The variation familiar to Europeans and Americans traveled through Iran (Persia) to the main commercial centers of Italy and Spain by about 1000 CE. A bit later, sea-faring Vikings carried the game into Scandinavia and Iceland. By 1100-1200 CE, the game became known in central Europe, and was well-established across all of Europe by 1400 CE, with the game rules which we use today.</description>

        <description>InThrough the Desert,two to five players each control a tribe of nomads vying for control of the desert. By establishing caravans and taking over oases, the players gain points as their tribes increase in power.Strategy is essential in deciding how and where to build your tribe's caravans. There are multiple ways to gain points and several ways to win. Should you try to build the longest caravan? Or should you dominate the desert's oases? Don't forget to keep an eye on your opponents' caravans, or you may find your own tribe cut off from valuable water holes.</description>

        <description>InCastellan,two players work together to build a castle. Finely-detailed wall and tower pieces link together to form courtyards, and the player who finishes a courtyard claims it with a Keep, scoring points for that courtyard equal to the number of tower pieces surrounding it.Each player starts the game with two decks of cards: a wall deck and a tower deck. Each card allows a player to play the components shown on it, with the wall deck cards always depicting at least one wall (and some combination of walls/towers) and the tower deck cards always depicting at least one tower (and again some combination of walls/towers). On a turn, a player can play as many cards as she wants, but she draws only one card at the end of her turn. The goal is to create courtyards â€“ and subdivide existing courtyards â€“ while keeping your opponent from doing the same. Players have the same cards in their decks, so the challenge is all about what to use when. The game ends when all the castle pieces are used up, and the player with the most points wins.</description>

        <description>The Mosquitopieces can be added to a standardHiveset and are placed in the same way as other pieces. Once in play, a Mosquito can take on the movement ability of any creature of either colour that it is touching at the start of its move (a stack with a Beetle on top counting as a Beetle for this purpose), thus changing its movement characteristics throughout the game.Exceptions:If a Mosquito is only touching another Mosquito at the start of its move, it may not move at all. If a Mosquito is moved as a Beetle onto the top of the Hive, then it continues to move as a Beetle until it climbs down.</description>

        <description>La Boca, the most famous neighborhood in the Argentinian capital of Buenos Aires, was populated by many Italian immigrants when first founded. The area is best known today for its eccentric skyline, with the houses having been built from scrapped fishing boats and the metal being colorfully painted to create a patchwork effect across the neighborhood.Creating skylines of similar beauty and eccentricity is the goal of the construction teams that playLa Boca. In shifting teams of two that sit across from one another, players try to create skylines on challenge cards â€“ but the players can see the completed image only from their point of view, so they must consult with one another constantly to make sure each colored block ends up in the right location while racing against the timer. The faster the players complete their building, the more points they score. Then the next team takes a seat, breaks down the blocks, then begins building anew. Whoever has the most points after a certain number of rounds will stand atop La Boca and glory in the cheers of the Argentinian public!</description>

        <description>In Onitama, players will vie to capture their opponentâ€™s Master, or, traverse their Master across the board to their opponentâ€™s Masterâ€™s starting position to win the game. To do this, you will be armed with a handful of special and ancient maneuvers, presented on beautiful Tarot size cards, that manipulate the field of battle to your advantage. Will you use the Dragon to overpower your opponent, the Horse to outmaneuver them, or the Cobra to strike quickly?These special moves are not yours alone though. In Onitama, players will shuffle the deck of moves, dealing two moves to each player to begin a game. In addition, a 5th will be placed face up, to the side of the board. When it is your turn, you may choose to move any piece using your cards, however, the card you choose to use will then be exchanged with the card to the side of the board. This means your opponent will have access to that move, after their next! Can you out-think, out-maneuver, and out-wit your opponent?With multiple moves to make every game unique, the speed, the grace, and the unique play style of Onitama truly makes this an Essential game for any gamerâ€™s collection!</description>

        <description>In this third addition to the GIPF Project players compete to acquire sets of multi-colored balls. This is mostly accomplished by jumping one ball over one or more others, Checkers-style, on a hex board. A player's turn consists of either jumping (which can be forced) or placing any color ball on the board and removing an empty space from the edge of the board. In this manner, the play space continually shrinks, giving the endgame an almost claustrophobic feel.</description>

        <description>Backgammon is believed to have originated at around 3,000 B.C.E. in Mesopotamia in the Persian Empire which is the present day Iran, Iraq, and Syria. It is the oldest known recorded game in history, even older than Chess.Backgammon is a game for two players, played on a board consisting of twenty-four narrow triangles called points. The triangles alternate in color and are grouped into four quadrants of six triangles each. The quadrants are referred to as a player's home board and outer board, and the opponent's home board and outer board. The home and outer boards are separated from each other by a ridge down the center of the board called the bar.</description>

        <description>TZAARis a game about making choices.Both players have 30 pieces, divided in three types: 6 Tzaars, 9 Tzarras and 15 Totts. The 3 types of pieces form a trinity: they cannot exist without each other. The aim is either to make the opponent run out of one of the three types of pieces or to put him in a position in which he cannot capture anymore.The tricky question the players will have to ask themselves on each of their turns is: â€œShall I make myself stronger or my opponent weaker?â€� Meaning: will you capture an opponentâ€™s piece and make him weaker, or will you jump on top of one of your own pieces and make yourself stronger? If you choose to jump on top of your own pieces too often, you will probably leave your opponent with too many pieces on the board. On the other hand, if you capture too often, you may end up with pieces that are not strong enough at the end of the game. What to do? Up to you to decide!</description>

        <description>DVONNis a challenging stacking game with very simple rules. It is played with 3 redDVONNpieces, 23 white pieces, and 23 black pieces. The players must try to control as many pieces as possible by building stacks, preferably by jumping on top of their opponentâ€™s pieces. While doing so, pieces and stacks must remain linked to the redDVONNpieces. If not, they are out of the game! When no more moves can be made, each player puts their stacks on top of each other. The player with the highest stack wins the game!GIPF is the first and central game of Project GIPF, a series of 6 games for 2 players. TAMSK is the second game, ZERTZ the t hird, andDVONNthe fourth. The Project is a system that makes it possible to combine games - not only the games of the project itself, but any game or challenge. This system is based on the use of potentials. Each game of the project introduces its own new potential into GIPF.images @ Rio Grande</description>

        <description>Crack your code first! You can see your opponents' codes but not your own. Using questions and logic, try to deduce which three numbers are hidden in front of you. Once you're reasonably sure, then you can take a guess. But if you're wrong, you have to start over with a fresh set of tiles...The players each receive a rack, a sheet from the notepad, and a CODE 777â„¢ card. Each player then takes three tiles placing them on their rack facing away so that the player cannot see the numbers. The numbers on the tiles must be fully visible to all the other players. Each player can now see the numbers of all his opponents but not those in his own rack.The Question cards and the tiles are shuffled and placed face down in the center of the play area. In turn, each player takes the top question card from the stack, reads it out loud and answers the question asked. The question is about the numbers that the player can see and not about the numbers on his own rack. For example, a question may be, "Do you see more blue sevens or more sevens of a different color?"The answer may be "More blue" or "More of a different colour" or "Just as many" (this is the answer if there are the same numbers of sevens or if there are no sevens at all). The player simply counts the tiles indicated by the question and provides the answer to all other players. Each answer gives everyone, except the reader, a bit more information.If a player thinks that he knows the numbers on his rack, he can guess the solution. One point is awarded for a correct solution. No points are scored for a wrong solution. In both cases the tiles are taken out of the player's rack, and replaced by three new ones. The first player to score three points is the winner.</description>

        <description>A seemingly simple puzzle game,Convertpushes spacial awareness to the next level. By manipulating pieces to fit with each other, players attempt to score rows, while claiming spaces on the board by converting them to their color.Unlike many other abstract games that leave all of the scoring to the end,Convertcreates a dimension of play that challenges players to battle for points throughout the entire game. First, players collect points as they create each row of four squares, and finally, this score is added to the amount of squares they occupy as seen from above.This isn't as easy at it looks though, as each piece you place causes the board to climb taller, making pieces more difficult to play! We have yet to see a game of Convert be played where the players haven't literally become "vertical" themselves and stand up to get a better look!</description>

        <description>GIPFis a strategic game for two players based on a classic concept: in turns, players introduce one piece into play until achieving four-in a-row. Players then remove their row and capture any of their opponent's pieces which extend that row. This principle of capturing pieces creates each time again completely changed situations on the board. The purpose is to form successive rows of at least 4 pieces, until the opponent has no piece left to bring into play.GIPFis not only the name of a game, but of a project as well. This project concerns a group of games and extra pieces that will follow step by step. Each game of the project will be playable either separately, or, by means of extra pieces, in combination with GIPF. It concerns a system that makes winning or losing GIPF-related games a strategic factor of the gameGIPFitself.</description>

            <description>Shuurorecreates a battlefield on a twelve by twelve squares chessboard, which is therefore larger than a traditional chessboard (8X8). On this, before each game the players place eight cubic plinths of the same dimensions as the squares themselves, to represent in a stylised fashion the elements of terrain and buildings that are found on battlefields. These plinths obstacle the movement of the pieces, limiting the advantage that queen, rooks and bishops would have on such a large board, and instead favouring knights, that can jump these obstacles or even use them as impregnable castles. The fact that the plinths are randomly placed before each game ensures that the game is always new and challenging.The second concept that setsShuuroapart from traditional chess is the choice of chess pieces, which simulates the fact that in reality armies are never identical to the enemy. Like in three-dimensional wargaming, each piece available to the playerâ€™s choice has a set points value (for example, a Queen is worth 110 points, a rook is 70 points and a pawn is 10). Before the game, the players decide how many points they will be able to field in total (800 points, for example), and then build a chess army depending on their tactical preferences. So a player might have an army consisting of two queens, three rooks, four bishops, four knights and six pawns, while the opponent could have opted for no queens, but two rooks, six bishops, eight knights and twelve pawns.Once again, the great variety of possible permutations, combined with the changing of the battlefield, makes every game ofShuurodifferent from the previous one.</description>

            <description>TAMSKis a game for 2 players, which is played under permanent time pressure. Both players start the game with 3 hourglasses and 32 rings. The hourglasses are the playing pieces; the aim is to get rid of as many rings as possible. Each turn you must move one of your hourglasses and turn it over; next you may play a ring in the newly covered space. The more spaces you visit, the more rings you will be able to play. But watch your hourglasses closely; each one that runs out of time is lost!TAMSKintroduces time as a substantial strategic element. If you are prepared to think fast and to play quickly without losing your cool, then you have the right attitude. Enjoy the pressure!</description>

            <description>In the oldest poem of Norse Mythology, the VÃ¶luspÃ¡ tells the story of the endless struggle of powerful gods, dangerous creatures, and forgotten races. Which beings will dominate? Here the story will unfold differently each time, as a new force rises in dominance!In the game, VÃ¶luspÃ¡, the players play tiles with twelve different characters and creatures of Norse Mythology, using the power of these tiles to block, capture or intimidate in order to control other tiles and score points. The player who scores the most points by dominating other tiles wins the game.VÃ¶luspÃ¡ is an easy to learn tile-laying game with great depth. It is a reimagining and retheming of the highly regarded game, Kachina.VÃ¶luspÃ¡ includes the expansion module Saga of Edda, which offers even more strategic opportunities and replayability!images Â© White Goblin Games</description>

            <description>Cozmica plays on a 9 x 9 grid board like a Go board. There are 36 pieces (stones), 18 each player (black and white).Each player has 6 Animal, 6 Plant, and 6 Microbe DNA pieces (stones). Animal takes Plant, Plant takes Microbe, Microbe takes Animal. All the pieces move the same way (like a king in chess but can move 2 spaces any direction instead of 1).The object of the game is to establish a colony (1Animal,1Plant, 1Microbe) that you have either captured of the opponent's DNA pieces by surrounding them, or you crossed 1 each of your own DNA pieces to the other side and off the board. It is OK to mix the opponents and your own pieces to create a colony.During the battle you can diminish your opponents Bio-ship fleet by intercepting and eliminating them.</description>

            <description>For half a millenium, a group of ghosts have been growing quite weary of one another's company in an old Scottish castle. Since they are thoroughly bored with the social scene of the stony structure, each ghost secretly wishes to escape the castle and go on wild adventures. Unfortunately, the ghosts are trapped there.Suddenly, an opportunity arises! They discover three glimmering magical portals that they might be able to use to find freedom. Desperation sets in quickly, because they know the portals won't be open long, so the ghosts scramble and jostle one another, trying to slip through the portals while they have the chance. They certainly don't want to see each other's ethereal faces for another 500 years!</description>

            <description>An archeological dig in the Iraqi city of Ur unearthed a game that appears similar to checkers. Carbon dating puts the game around 3,000 B.C.E. No one is certain of the rules for this early version of the game. Egyptian pharaohs played a game called Alquerque on a five-by-five board, which has been traced back as early as 1400 B.C.E The ancient Greeks also had a version of checkers that goes back as far as 1600 B.C.E.In France, around 1100 someone got the idea of playing the game on a chess board. This meant expanding the number of pieces to 12 on a side. It was then called "Fierges" or "Ferses". It was soon found that making jumps mandatory made the game more challenging. The French called this version "Jeu Force". Now the rules for checkers that we are familiar with were set, and the game was exported to England and America. In Great Britain the game was called "Draughts".Each player gets 12 pieces in one color. All the pieces sit on the black squares. Players move pieces diagonally across the board in a forward direction.The goal is to eliminate the other playerâ€™s pieces by â€œjumpingâ€� them (and taking them off of the board). A piece that makes it all the way across the board is â€œcrownedâ€� king, often by having another checker placed on top of it. King pieces can move either diagonally forward or diagonally backwards across the board.</description>

            <description>Test your code-cracking prowess withMastermind, the challenging game of logic and deduction. Can you crack the code in 10 moves or less? Can you create a code than canâ€™t be cracked? With more than 55 million units sold, Mastermind is a great strategy game . . . and one of the worldâ€™s most popular games ever. Itâ€™s easy to learn and fast to play, and with more than 2,000 possible codes itâ€™s different every time. The Codemaker sets a secret code, then the Codebreaker tries to match the code using logic, deduction, and maybe even a little bit of luck. After each move, the Codemaker gives clues to the Codebreaker. Make the code even more devious by using multiple pegs of the same color or by leaving one or more peg holes empty. With so many possible code combinations, every game is guaranteed to be a brainteaser. All of this mind gameâ€™s components can be stored in the game board. The winner will be a true master mind.Mastermindis based on a pencil and paper game called Bulls and Cows. Rather than colors, the code is 4 digits. As the opponents guess the digits, matching digits are called â€œbulls,â€� while wrong guesses are â€œcowsâ€�.Leading game companies initially rejected the game, but Mordecai Meirowitz finally took it to the International Toy Fair in 1971. There, he showed it to Invicta Plastics, an English company. Invicta Plastics changed up the rules a bit, gave it the name â€œMaster Mindâ€� and released it in 1971. The game was a hit: 50 million copies were sold throughout 80 countries. It was the most popular new board game of the decade.The game has been reprinted several times, with one version having a scoring system for up to 5 players. There are also online versions of the game. The current version by Pressman is for two players.</description>

            <description>Chinese Checkers was invented in Germany in 1892 and it's derived from the game of Halma (1883). Chinese Checkers is not from China and it really has nothing to do with the game Checkers.The first game of Chinese Checkers was published and patented by the German game company Ravensburger (Otto Robert Maier) under the name Stern-Halma (stern means star in English; Star-Halma) in 1892. Spears &amp; Sons introduced the star board to England in 1909.The first Chinese Checkers game to be published in the United States was 'Hop Ching Checkers' in 1928 by J. Pressman &amp; Co. This was the same game as the 1892 Star-Halma. The brothers Bill and Jack Pressman made up the name 'Chinese Checkers' around 1928. The game was given a Chinese name and theme in keeping with the current interest in all things oriental (among them the discovery of King Tut's tomb in 1922 and the 'mah jongg' game that was introduced in 1923).In the 1930s a craze for Chinese Checkers swept across America. Several other manufactures started to make the game. Many were given other names; but since no one seemed to own the rights to the name; many were just called Chinese Checkers. The Milton Bradley Company got a patent on Chinese Checkers thirteen years later (1941).Players jump over their own and their opponents' pieces with the objective of being the first to move all their pieces from one side to the opposing side.</description>

            <description>With more than 50 million units sold, Rummikub is one of the worldâ€™s best-selling and most-played games. It has all the elements that make a great game. Itâ€™s easy to learn and fast moving. The â€œboardâ€� changes all the time as players adjust the tiles on the table. It combines luck and strategy and it changes quickly so every player has a chance to win until the very end. Players take turns placing numbered tiles in runs (consecutive numbers of the same color, like 2, 3, 4 in red) and groups (three or more of the same number in different colors, like a red 9, a blue 9 and a black 9), rummy style. The Joker tiles add to the fun; they can be any color or number. The object is to be the first to play every tile on your rack.Rummikub is ideal for people of different ages to play together, and itâ€™s great for a game night too. When kids play, it reinforces STEM and STEAM concepts such as sequencing, pattern recognition and planning skills. Itâ€™s got lots of exciting moments, but itâ€™s also designed to bring people together, with plenty of opportunities for talking, chatting, and sharing with family and friends. For 2 or more players, ages 8 and up.Check out some of our other Rummikub games: Rummikub in Retro Tin, Rummikub Large Number Edition &amp; Rummikub Deluxe.1980 Spiel des Jahres Winner</description>

Retaining the spirit of its predecessor,Ingenious Challengesis one box with three unique games that each focus on matching symbols while varying the types of matches made.In the Card Challenge, test your wits by strategically playing cards from your hand to match the symbols on the card in front of you. In the Dice Challenge, tempt fate by deducing when to keep your best roll.

The Tile Challenge will make you risk it all for additional points. If your tile matches, you can take the points right away or toss caution in the wind to draw an additional tile. If the new one doesnâ€™t match, you score no points that turn.With three new ways to test your mental mettle there is no better time than now to stand up and shout â€œIngenious!â€�</description>

            <description>The 20â€™s, Prohibition and its famous Speakeasies. With your clan of gangsters will you succeed in finding your opponentâ€™s speakeasy before he finds yours? A good poker face, courage and a bit of luck should help.Secretly send your goons on the city streets to scare away your opponentâ€™s gangsters. But beware of Agents and Babes that will drive away even the strongest gangster and, most important, do not forget to protect yourSpeakeasy.On their side of the board, players place their 25 pieces face turned in order to hide each pieceâ€™s value from their opponent.â€‹ They take turns to move along streets, alleys and even in buildings that serve as a "stash". When two pieces meet, the highest value scares the other one way, removing the lower value off the board. Special pieces move faster or scare away all the others disappearing themselves in the action. Player's Speakeasy is placed on one of the two yellow buildings on his side of the board. Are the moves to defend or attack? And the "timing", will it be enough?A game of strategy for two players,Speakeasyis easy to learn and appealing for both beginners and experienced players.Inspired byLu Zhan Qi, a Chinese game that has proven its excellence for many years,Speakeasyuses memory and anticipation during games full of bluff.Put some jazz as background music, look at your opponentright in the eye and push away his Boss with a smirk.That'sSpeakeasy.images Â© Capsicum Games</description>

            <description>16th century explorers discovered a small island chain off the coast of South America, which had once been home to an ancient tribe of artists and spiritualists, for whom color had great religious important. The artefacts discovered by the explorers consisted primarily of brightly-colored tiles, along with texts which revealed that the tribal priests would assemble into wheels whose patterns they believed inspired artistic visions and psychic powers.Returning to Europe with their finds, the explorers formed a secret society to attempt to recreate the rituals and unlock the power of the tiles. Over the years, their experiments evolved into a game, which they calledVizia. Nowadays, few people believe that the tiles hold genuine magical power, and yet,Viziais a game that might itself help you become more perceptive!Players take turns placing one or more triangular colored tiles, subject to certain rules of color sequences. For instance, a green tile may only touch a blue or yellow tile (the two colors green is made of). Forming complete "wheels" (hexagons comprised of six tiles) scores points, while certain special types of wheels (two-colored wheels and full wheels) score extra.</description>

            <description>With nothing but four stacks of coloured tiles, itâ€™s no wonder whyOK Playis regarded as the worldâ€™s easiest to understand game. Donâ€™t let that fool you though - whilst this game takes minutes to learn, it takes ages to master.The rules are simple: using your stack of tiles, you try to make a line of five before any of your opponents can. Each tile must line up with the flat side of another (no placing corners on corners) and can go horizontally, vertically or diagonally. If you manage to use all of your tiles and thereâ€™s still no winner, you can reposition them one at a time.Whether youâ€™re from Albania or Zambia, speaking in Urdu or Zulu or playing against a rabbi or a Jedi,OK Playcan go anywhere and be played by anyone, with anyone (even if you canâ€™t understand a word the other person is saying).OK Playis definitely the easiest-to-learn game weâ€™ve ever made, but the hardest to win.Itâ€™s a bit like an off-road connect four but for 2 to 4 players. There is no board, so you can go off in random directions, and if you run out of tiles you can reposition them.OK Playâ€” take it anywhere, play with anyone.NOTE: The first edition of the game had 21 tiles in each of four colors. The current version has 15 in each color.</description>

                    <description>Qwirkle Cubesis a sequel of sorts to Qwirkle with the goal of the game being the same as before: Create rows and columns in which the tokens all match either in color or symbol in order to score points. Each time you add tokens to the playing area, you score points equal to the rows/columns that you create or add to. Close out a row by playing the sixth token in it, and you score six bonus points in addition to whatever else you score for the turn.In Qwirkle, the pieces have a colored symbol on one face and are otherwise blank, but in Qwirkle Cubes the tokens have six faces in the same color, with each face having a different one of the six symbols. On a turn, you:Roll as many cubes from your hand as you want.Play cubes from your hand to build color lines and symbol lines.Draw and roll replacement cubes.All the cubes are visible, so players can better judge their opponents' future moves â€“ notwithstanding their rolls, mind you. The game continues until no more cubes remain in the reserve pool and one player has placed all of her cubes. This player scores a six point bonus, then the player with the most points wins!AWARDS2009 Doctor Toy Award2009 Major Fun Award2009 Parents' Choice Recommended Award</description>

                    <description>Battle to claim spaces, control them to score points. But be preparedâ€¦ a well timed action card can support or hinder any playerâ€™s game â€” including your own!Stratagemis simple game perfect for family fun night, but also substantial enough to be a go-to game even for the avid gamer.Stratagemis a roll and move based game. Players take turns moving their pawns around the board, claiming each contiguous space they enter with hexagon tiles. Points are scored for each claimed space that survives a round and is converted to a controlled space. Action cards may be played during the game to a playerâ€™s advantage.Prefer Skill Over Luck?Avid gamers may prefer a more strategic rule-set, one that relies more heavily on the playerâ€™s skill than the luck of a die roll. In this variant, players must move three spaces instead of rolling a die for movement, putting the playerâ€™s fate in their own hands.NOTE: As of May 30, 2014, the initial Kickstarter campaign did not fund successfully. 6th Gear Games promises a relaunch, but it has not yet been scheduled.</description>

                    <description>Snippetsis the fast paced anything goes word game!Perfect for a party or family game night,Snippetsis for 2-8 players and takes about 45 minutes. It can best be described as a combination ofScrabbleandScattergories, but unlikeScrabble, you donâ€™t need a crazy vocabulary to win, unlikeScattergoriesthereâ€™s no ambiguity, and unlike most word games, the â€œsmartestâ€� player doesnâ€™t always win.With its unique "anything goes" rule,Snippetsisn't like most word games, requiring more of a creative mind than a large vocabulary. And with only 60 seconds to think, everyoneâ€™s answers will be equally hilarious.NOTE:The game also has free downloadable companion app which can stand in as the sand timer.</description>

                    <description>King of Tokyois a game from Richard Garfield for 2 to 6 players in which you will be able to play mutant monsters, gigantic robots and other aliens, all of whom are happily whacking each other in a joyous atmosphere in order to become the one and only King of Tokyo.When it is your turn to play, you throw six dice. Each die bears the following six symbols: 1, 2 or 3 Points of Destruction, Energy, Healing and Whack. In three successive throws, you are going to choose whether to keep or discard each die in order to come up with combinations that will enable you to win destruction points, hoard energy, restore your health or whack other players into understanding Tokyo is YOUR territory.The fiercest player will be crowned King of Tokyo... and will end up facing all the other monsters alone!Top this off with special cards that you can purchase with energy and that have a permanent or temporary effect, such as the growing of a second head which grants you an additional die, body armor, nova death ray, and more.... and you hold one of the most explosive games of the year!In order to win the game, one must either destroy Tokyo by accumulating 20 destruction points, or be the only surviving monster once the fighting has ended.images Â© iello</description>

                    <description>Your task seems simple. You are given a word, and you need your teammates to guess it. But the other team has already seen your word, and they have made a list of "trapwords" that you can't say. You don't know what's on their list. And there's a time limit. Go!Trapwords is a fun and fast-paced party game for two teams, who simultaneously prepare their lists of trapwords. The simple task of giving clues for your word is made fiendishly difficult by not knowing which words you can't say. If you succeed, you advance to higher levels with more trapwords and additional challenges. Includes a set of regular words as well as a set with a fantasy theme.</description>

                    <description>Set in the near future,The Resistancepits a small group of resistance fighters against a powerful and corrupt government. The resistance has launched a series of bold and daring missions to bring the government to its knees. Unfortunately spies have infiltrated the resistance ranks, ready to sabotage the carefully crafted plans. Even a single spy can take down a resistance mission team, choose your teams carefully or forever lose your chance for freedom.Included in this release is a full expansion - "The Plot Thickens" is 15 additional action cards that increase the pressure and pacing of the game, and requires the spies to be even more deceitful if they are to achieve victory.The Resistanceartfully balances pure deduction elements with the social elements into a game that creates the adrenaline filled moments of high stakes poker but in a full interactive and social event. Its not for the faint of heart, or slow of mind - but if you are quick on your feet you'll be proud of your hard fought victories.</description>

                        <description>IN A WORLDâ€¦ where people love movies and stuff thatâ€™s really really funny, one game embarks on an epic quest to create the greatest laugh of all time. Galactic Sneeze presents:SCHMOVIE.What would you call a HORROR FILM about an EVIL BOOGER? A SCI-FI about a GANGSTA LUNCH LADY? A ROMANTIC COMEDY about a CLUMSY PROCTOLOGIST? The object of SCHMOVIE is to come up with funny titles for make believe movies based on a film genre (determined by the roll of a die), combined with an outlandish premise (established by flipping two cards). Each round, a Schmovie Producer selects his or her favorite title and awards a Schquid Trophy. First player to collect four Schquids wins!Schmoviecan be played family-friendly or for adults-only. It's a hit with kids as young as 8 by removing some of the more mature cards. Or, it can be edged up for some racy laughs by suggesting "Adult Film" when the die lands on the question mark.images Â© Galactic SneezeAdditional Schmovie Fun on Facebook!Come join our play-along Facebook page. We post new rounds of the game every Monday and Thursday night, and create custom tricked-out Schquid trophies for each winner. We've now received over 30,000 Schmovie titles and have created hundreds of Schquids!Visit the Schmovie facebook page &gt;</description>

                        <description>Every picture tells a story â€“ but what story will your picture tell?Dixit is the lovingly illustrated game of creative guesswork, where your imagination unlocks the tale. In this award-winning board game, players will use the beautiful imagery on their cards to bluff their opponents and guess which image matches the story. Guessing right is only half the battle â€“ to really succeed, youâ€™ll have to get your friends to decide that your card tells the story!Every turn, the storyteller will call out a short phrase or word to match the image on his card. Then each player will choose the card that most closely matches that phrase, and then everyone must guess which card the storyteller saw when he invented his brief tale. Correctly guess the storytellerâ€™s card, and youâ€™ll move ahead. Convince everyone else that your card is best, and youâ€™ll do even better.Dixit is a wonderfully simple game, playable by nearly anyone with whom you share a common language. With a fantastic range of beautiful illustrations and rules that can be understood by children and adults alike, Dixit will appeal to anyone with an imagination. Itâ€™s no surprise that Dixit won the Spiel de Jahres award for game design in 2010. It is brilliant and simple, beautiful and imaginative, and fun for all.image Â© Asmodee</description>

Eachteam has 60 seconds to get through as many weird, inappropriate names as theycan, from Drunk Jeff Goldblum to Shirtless Vladimir Putin.In the first round, you can say anything you want. In the second, you can only use one word. And in the third, you canâ€™t say anything at all â€” just gestures. The same cards are used in each round, so by the end of the game, youâ€™ve made up a bunch of hilarious jokes together.</description>

Every night, the werewolves devour another of the innocent townsfolk, and by day, the survivors must root out the monsters and lynch them to prevent the spread of their horrible curse. Try to see through the web of lies and suspicion to find the real villains, and bring them to justice before the town is left empty and dead.The Villageis a standalone party game where every player is a member of the town.

Players flip cards in turn until the symbols on two playersâ€™ cards match. Matching players must race to give an example of the category on their opponentâ€™s card. Whoever blurts out a correct answer first wins their opponentâ€™s card, and drawing continues. Sounds easy, right? Think again! Wild cards create unexpected matches, and face-offs can cascade when you lose a card, revealing a new match. Pay attention - it could be your turn at any time!Fast moving and hilarious,Anomiawill have everyone roaring with laughter as they try to beat each other to the punch!

                        <description>A Game of Deception, Paranoia, and Mob RuleA vengeful group of villagers must figure out who among them is a werewolf (before itâ€™s too late...)Are You A Werewolf?is a deception party game for 7-15 players. Players are assigned roles secretly. Most players are Villagers, two or three will be Werewolves.The Villagers try to figure out who the werewolves are during the day, and the Werewolves eat the Villagers at night.Game PlayThis is a very unusual game. Each player is randomly assigned a secret identity, and then the group sits around and talks to each other trying to figure out which players are the werewolves. The villagers are trying to figure out who's a werewolf; the werewolves are pretending to be villagers, and trying to throw suspicion on real villagers. A moderator helps to keep the action going...It should be noted that this game was not invented by Andrew Looney. It's based on an enduring public domain classic (more commonly known asMafia) which is played with a standard deck of cards. It's a game the Looneys played frequently, having been taught the game by their friend Andrew Plotkin who added the Werewolf theme. We grew weary of using plain old marked up playing cards, and back in 2001 (as our Holiday Gift to our fans) created a set of more appropriately themed cards, featuring artwork by Alison.NOTE: Looney Labs also produced a Deluxe Edition ofAre You A Werewolf?as aKickstarter project, which was fulfilled in March 2013. That version is not generally commercially available.</description>

                        <description>Epic Picnicis a no-holds-barred, blast of a party game inspired by a verbal memory game from our childhood, but corrupted with humor from our adult life. Players use cards to represent incredible and ridiculous things they're bringing on the picnic. The goal is to stay focused and remember what everyone is bringing in a hilarious, memory challenging face-off that pushes the boundaries of social convention.</description>

                        <description>Ultimate Werewolfis an interactive game of deduction for two teams: Villagers and Werewolves. The Villagers don't know who the Werewolves are, and the Werewolves are trying to remain undiscovered while they slowly eliminate the Villagers one at a time. A Moderator (who isn't on a team) runs the game.Included for a limited time: theWolfpackexpansion!Ultimate Werewolftakes place over a series of game days and nights. Each day, the players discuss who among them is a Werewolf and vote out a player. Each night, the Werewolves choose a player to eliminate, while the Seer learns whether one player is a Werewolf or not. The game is over when either all the Villagers or all the Werewolves are eliminated.Ultimate Werewolf: Deluxe Editionfeatures all new artwork, a great new design, totally rewritten and more comprehensive rules, and an even better moderator scorepad. What's more, it supports more players than ever: 75 of your closest friends can converge on one or more villages using the components in this box.NOTE: This version of the game was produced after a successful Kickstarter campaign. Backers received copies of updated editions of theClassic Movie Monsters,Night Terrors, andUrban Legendsexpansions as stretch goals, as well as 20 bonus cards, a deeper storage box, and access to different art packs by various artists.This non-Kickstarter version is available separately commercially, as well as a non-Deluxe version. This is the 2014 version of the game. Prior versions were published as the Ultimate Edition (2008-2013) and the Whitebox Edition (2007-2008).</description>

                        <description>In Deception: Murder in Hong Kong, players find themselves in a scenario of intrigue and murder, deduction and deception. One player is the Murderer, secretly choosing their weapon and the evidence they leave behind. Another is the Forensic Scientist who holds the key to convicting the criminal but is only able to express their knowledge through analysis of the scene. The rest are investigators, interpreting the clues to solve the crime â€“ and the killer is among them. Investigators must collaborate and use their wits, their hunches, and their keen deductive insight to correctly identify the means of murder and the key evidence to convict the killer. The murderer must mislead and confuse the investigators to save themselves.Do you have what it takes to see through the lies and catch the criminal in your ranks or will they muddy the waters long enough to get away with murder?Deception: Murder in Hong Kong is a re-implementation of CS-Files by Jolly Thinkers. We are very excited to announce the game has received the Dice Tower Seal of Excellence and Grey Fox Games is proud to be bringing this great game to a wider audience.</description>

PLEASE DO NOT rate this game if you have not played it!Your mission, Martians, is to swoop down on the pathetic denizens of the primitive planet â€œEarthâ€�, and to scoop up as many of the inhabitants as you can manage. We are interested in samples of the Chicken, Cow, and Human populations, so that we can determine which of them is actually in charge. The Earthlings might manage to put up a feeble defense, but surely nothing that a small taste of your Death Rays canâ€™t handle.

                        <description>Walk a mile in the shoes of a spy! Or was it a kilometer in clogs?SPYFALLis an easy-to-learn card game of bluffing, probing questions, clever answers, and suspicion. At the start of each round, players receive a secret card letting them know where they are â€“ a casino, space station, pirate ship, circus, (30 unique locations!) â€“ except that one player receives the SPY card instead of the location. The Spy doesnâ€™t know where he is, but wins the round if he can figure it out before he blows his cover!Players then start asking each other questions during the intense 8-minute rounds. Non-Spy players want to ask questions and give answers that prove to the other players that they know where they are. But watch out! If your questions and answers are too specific, the Spy will easily guess the location and win, so you need to practice a bit of subtlety. But if your questions and answers are too generic, you might be accused of being the Spy. The Spy will also sometimes be asked questions (just like any other player would) and have to come up with questions of his own, without knowing anything about where he is! If you listened carefully to the other players, youâ€™ll be able to come up with a plausible question or answerâ€¦ hopefully.Once per round, each player may accuse another player of being the Spy. If all players agree, the game ends and that playerâ€™s secret card is flipped up. If the Spy is captured, each of the Non-Spy players win the round. If a Non-Spy is revealed, the Spy wins. Finally, if the Spy figures out where he is, he can reveal his card and make a guess. If heâ€™s right, he wins the round. If not, the Non-Spy players win.The game is played over a series of rounds and points are awarded each round. A complete game is typically five rounds and the cards are randomly dealt each round. You could even be the Spy two rounds in a row! After the last round, the player with the most points is the winner.</description>

                        <description>Test your observational skills and hone your reflexes with the award-winning game play ofSpot It!, a game of lightning-fast choices for a group of two to eight players. With dozens of awards and possible versions married to elegant gameplay,Spot It!has become a global phenomenon. The game functions on a simple mechanicâ€”fifty-five circular cards, each of which features a number of symbols and has exactly one of those symbols in common with every other card in the deck. With five distinct mini-games, you can be sure thatSpot It!will be different every time you play, and because itâ€™s always your turn, thereâ€™s never any downtime!Thereâ€™s Only One MatchNo matter which version ofSpot It!youâ€™re enjoying, the basic principle remains the same. Each set ofSpot It!contains a wide variety of circular cards. Each of these cards has eight different symbols. For example, in the baseSpot It!game, one card may have symbols that show a spider, a snowman, a clown, a lightning bolt, a target, an anchor, a stop sign, and a pair of sunglasses.Each of these circular cards has exactly one of its symbols in common with each other card in the game. No matter which mini-game you play in your game ofSpot It!, the heart of the game will be trying to find the one common symbol shared between two cards. For eachSpot It!mini-game, players donâ€™t pause to take turnsâ€”itâ€™s everybodyâ€™s turn, all the time. Youâ€™ll need to be quick as well as observant if you plan to win.From this simple mechanic, every game ofSpot It!offers countless variations with five distinct mini-games to test your observation and pattern-finding abilities. You may choose to play The Tower mini-game, for example. In this mini-game, each player starts with one card facedown in front of them. All the other cards are placed in a stack between the players. The top card of the stack is revealed, and then, at the same time, all of the players reveal their cards. If you're the first player to find the matching symbol between your card and the card on top of the stack, you can call out the name of the symbol and claim the card, placing it on top of your first card and revealing a new card from the stack. When the stack has been depleted, whichever player has the most cards wins the mini-game!Alternatively, you may want to play Triplet. This mini-game begins by placing nineSpot It!cards face up in a three-by-three square. You and your opponents must compete to find sets of three cards that share the same symbol. As soon as you find a set, you call out the matching symbol, and remove those cards from the field, refilling their places with three new cards from the deck. When the deck is depleted, whoever has claimed the most sets wins.Endless PermutationsEven beyond the different experiences offered by the five different mini-games inSpot It!, you can enjoy dozens of other versions ofSpot It!as well. You may learn a few common words of another language with Spot It! Basic French or Spot It! Basic Spanish. You may represent your favorite activity with Spot It! Sports or Spot It! Gone Camping. You can even play with younger children withSpot It! AlphabetorSpot It Jr.! Animals. No matter who you are or how you prefer to play, thereâ€™s a version ofSpot It!for you to enjoy.Can You Find It?Put your observation to the test and find the matching symbols! Experience the endless variations and fast-paced, exciting gameplay ofSpot It!.</description>

                        <description>TheOutburstgame offers a high-energy, laugh-out-loud party game experience! This game of lists will get you on the edge of your seat as teams shout out words to match as many top 10 answers that are on the card, while the timer ticks down. With over 450 great topics, players will be challenged with a wide range of categories such as movies with mobsters, men's toiletries, things you blow, and kinds of cheese. The possible answers are endless, but the key is to match the words on the card. Players receive a point for each guess that's listed on the card, and the first team to get 60 points wins.Originally published in 1999.</description>

                        <description>In the Old West, the wily snake oil salesman had a special talent, getting the most skeptical customers to buy the most dubious products. Now it's your turn! Invent your own zany two-word products â€“ Rumor Mirror! Burp Balloon! â€“ and sell them to all types of wacky customers. If the round's customer buys your product, you win!To set upSnake Oil, each player takes six purple word cards. The customer for the round draws a red customer card and announces it. Inventors quickly combine two purple word cards from their hand to form a crazy new product to sell to that customer. When ready, they put their two word cards face down on the table. In clockwise order, each inventor quickly pitches his or her product directly to the customer. The customer can end any pitch that goes longer than thirty seconds. The customer decides which product to buy and gives the inventor of that product the round's customer card as the prize. Inventors discard all used word cards and take two new word cards each. The player to the left of the customer becomes the next round's customer. Play repeats until each player has been the customer once.Whoever collects the most customer cards wins.</description>

                        <description>Can you keep calm while bids are rising? Experience the exhilaration of real life auctions!InGoing, Going, GONE!, players try to win items by bidding on five simultaneous auctions while the Auctioneer counts down from 10 to 1! Players bid on these five simultaneous auctions by physically dropping their wooden cubes (known as "Bucks") into any or all of the five transparent Auction Cups, each of which represents an auction for one or two Item Cards.At the end of the countdown, the Auctioneer says "GONE!" and quickly places the Auction Paddle over the five Auction Cups to close the auctions. The player who has the most Bucks in each Auction Cup wins that auction and takes the Item Cards for that auction. Collections of items may be sold throughout the game for more Bucks, or players can keep building their collections to sell them at the end of the game. The player with the most Bucks at the end of the game wins!Going, Going, GONE!is a simple-to-learn, exciting and unique game for players of all skill levels! It is ideal for playing in public spaces. Since the players control the pacing of the game and the variants used, the game adapts to the playing style of the players.</description>

                        <description>Who are the most famous werewolves in the world? Better yet, how about the most famous *wolves* in the world?Ultimate Werewolf: Wolfpackhas them all and in ways you'd never expect.This expansion forUltimate Werewolfhas six new roles for your werewolfing fun. Think werewolves are too meek? That's because your villages have never had The Big Bad Wolf, who leads the werewolves to eliminate villagers twice as fast while he's in the game. On the opposite end of the spectrum is the terrifyingly-confused Fruit Brute, who is, of all things, a vegetarian. Elizabeth Taylor was pretty scary as Martha the crazy socialite, but every game you'll want to know who in your group is actually afraid of Virginia Woolf. And there's three more famous wolves, including one that totally coincidentally shares a name with one of the X-Men.This expansion is compatible withUltimate Werewolf(black backs). This expansion is included in theUltimate Werewolf Deluxe Edition.</description>

                        <description>Tap the Tapple Wheel!Tappleis the award-winning, fast-paced word game that gives families &amp; friends a rush of excitement as they compete to beat the timer! No need to spell just say your word, tap the timer, and pass the Tapple Wheel. The last person standing wins the round!Tapplewill entertain your friends &amp; family during holiday get-togethers, parties and more! The kids won't even know they're learning as they rush to tap the timer!Did You Know That...Tappleis originally based on the German gamePim Pam PetThe Tapple Wheel has 20 Letters. The six missing letters are: Q,U,V,X,Y,Z. These letters are the least commonly used letters to start a word in the English language.Once the buzzer is hit, each player only has TEN seconds to name something in his/her category.How to Win atTappleHere are a few tips on how to become a betterTappleplayerRemain Calm - A calm mind is a mind that can think under pressure. Practice meditative breathing before the game begins... or just relax to some sweet jams.As soon as the Category card is selected start making a list of words that fit that category in your head. Go into the round with a plan and feeling confident.While your opponents are going - start thinking of more words. Try to think of at least two in case they take your letter.In contrast, press the timer as quickly as possible after you answer so your opponents have less time to think during your turn.Move your feet while you're playing. Movement helps brain flow.Start breaking down things into categories in your every day life to work your category muscle. What colors do you know? What can you find in nature? Who are your favorite actors?Have lots of fun.How to UseTappleas an Educational ToolReading &amp; Writing:Turn off the timer! For kids who are still learning to read and write, pick a category, and give them time to think of a word that starts with a letter in each category. Have them go around the whole wheel and think of a word for each letter.Spelling:Try to spell a word in 10 seconds! Pick a word and have your student or child try to spell it within the 10 second time frame. If spelling is still new, turn off the timer and have them press down the buttons as they spell for more interactive fun.Quick Thinking:Try to think of two words in a category that start with the SAME letter every time you push a letter down.Teamwork:PlayTapplein teams. Separate your group into two teams. When one player from a team wins a round, the whole team gets the point. Give everyone a chance to work together and promote good teamwork &amp; sportsmanship.And of course, you can always playTappleclassic style since it's already fast word fun for everyone :)How To UseTappleas a Party GameUseTappleas an icebreaker- have all players pick an adjective, using the available letters on the Tapple Wheel, that describes them. This can be done with our without the timer.Give Prizes- Every time someone wins a round he/she gets a prize (For Kids: stuffed animal, fun munchable treat, etc; for adults Mardi Gras beads, party hats, etc)Give Party Time Consequences- Every time someone gets out in a round he/she has to do something 'bad' (For Kids: do a silly dance, tell a Joke; For Adults: take a drink, run a lap, etc)Special Events- If it's someone's birthday, wedding, baby shower, etc have everyone in the room use the Tapple Wheel to describe all the great things about the person using all the letters of the wheel.Party on Tapplers!Â images Â© USAopoly</description>

Can you pack'em, stack'em and rack'em with the best?Pack &amp; Stackis a fast and funny, wild and crazy game about moving stuff on all sorts of odd trucks. Every interactive turn is a new adventure, where all the players discover new loads, grab new trucks, and then gamble on their planning and packing skills. So, test your wits and find your cool.

                        <description>Taboois the game of unspeakable fun! Can you get your team to say Brain Freeze? What if you can't say Ice Cream, Headache, Eating, Cold or Fast? Not so easy now, is it? When you play Taboo, the obvious clues are strictly taboo! You have to give creative, carefully-worded clues to get your team to guess words fast. But don't mention unmentionables, or you'll get the squeaker and lose the point! Once you've mastered the classic game, you can use the game-changer die to mix it up. If it lands on One Guesser, only one teammate can guess on your turn. With 4 other possibilities on the die, you'd better be shrewd, quick-thinking and willing to take some risks - but don't get shut down by the squeaker!Classic Taboogame challenges you to guess words and phrases! You lose a point if you use any of the Taboo words! Game-changer die lets you change up the game once you've mastered the classic version! When a describer uses any Taboo words, use the squeaker to squeak them!</description>

                        <description>Ultimate Werewolf: Artifacts, the first-ever mega-expansion toUltimate Werewolf(and usable in other versions ofWerewolf), brings the game into the 21st century by using ancient artifacts to propel the game forward.Each player gets, in addition to hisUltimate Werewolfrole card, his own Artifact card. He secretly looks at that card, which has an artifact with some special power on it. At any time during the game, he can choose to reveal his Artifact card and use its special power. Some artifacts, like the Cloak of the Prince, provide a direct benefit to the player with the artifact. Others, like the Cudgel of the Old Hag, impact other players. And still others, like the Ring of Truth, provide information about another player in the game. Some artifacts might not be to your benefit to use right away, like the Claw of the Werewolf, but others, like the Ruby of Kismet, might cause someone to reveal and activate an artifact anyway!What this ends up doing is providing a whole new layer toUltimate Werewolfgames, adding new strategies and tactics to your games. Each game is different, with unique combinations of artifacts in the mix.</description>

                        <description>It's the moment of truth in your quest to destroy the Evil magic Key. Your band of adventurers faces two Wizards: an Evil Wizard who wants to use the key to unlock evil powers, and the Good Wizard who has the ability to destroy it. The problem is, the Evil Wizard has disguised himself to look exactly like the Good Wizard, so who do you give the Key to? Choose quickly: one of your trusted Guards is secretly a Traitor - and next round that Traitor might be you!Everyone is dealt a card assigning them a role. You could be the Good Wizard, the Evil Wizard, the Traitor, the Key-Holder, or a Guard. The Traitor and the Guards know who the Key Holder is, but only the Wizards know which is Good and which is Evil. The game proceeds as an open discussion about who might be the Traitor, which Wizard is Evil, etc, until someone makes a move that ends the round. If something Good happens (such as a Guard grabbing the Traitor or the Good Wizard being given the Key) then the Good players win the round, whereas the Evil Wizard and the Traitor win if the Evil Wizard gets the Key (or the Good players make a bad call). After each round, everyone on the winning team gets a Treasure card, with values ranging from 0-5 points. As soon as someone gets 10 points, that player wins!</description>

                            <description>We've all heard the stories: A giant furry beast roaming the hills. A mother bent on revenge for her unjust death. A mischievous taunting elf-like creature. But that's all they are, legendsâ€¦right?Urban Legendsbrings these characters to life withinUltimate Werewolf. If Bloody Mary dies, she starts killing the players who killed herâ€¦from the grave. The ferocious Chupacabra loves the taste of werewolf, but if he runs out of them, villagers will do. The Wolf Man hunts with the werewolves, but to the Seer he appears as an innocent villager. The tricky Leprechaun sides with the village, messing with the werewolves by changing their nighttime target. All Sasquatch ever wanted to do was to help the village kill werewolvesâ€¦but if the village wavers on this, Sasquatch will turn on them. And finally, Nostradamus has to make a name for himself by predicting who will win each game ofUltimate Werewolfâ€¦and then helps out his prediction. All or some of these characters can be added to yourUltimate Werewolfgames to make them even more compelling than before!This expansion is compatible withUltimate WerewolfandUltimate Werewolf Deluxe Edition(black backs).</description>

                            <description>THIS IS THE CARD GAME THAT MADE KICKSTARTER HISTORY.Created by Elan Lee (Xbox, ARGs), Matthew Inman (The Oatmeal), and Shane Small (Xbox, Marvel), Exploding Kittens made history when it became the most-backed game in Kickstarter history and the campaign with the most number of backers, ever.It is a highly-strategic, kitty-powered version of Russian Roulette. Players draw cards until someone draws an exploding kitten, at which point they explode, they are dead, and they are out of the game -- unless that player has a defuse card, which can defuse the kitten using things like laser pointers, belly rubs, and catnip sandwiches. All of the other cards in the deck are used to move, mitigate, or avoid the exploding kittens.</description>

                                <description>Pretenseis a game night social metagame, essentially a game that you play DURING other games. You have a secret role and a secret objective, and if you accomplish it, you gain a point AND you steal someone's role. With that role you can try to gain more points and more roles. The game plays from 2-12 and is great on a good-sized game night with about 5-6 people.</description>

In this lounge, the Mafia and the townâ€™s protectors are squaring off in secret.Nobody knows enough to tell either group apart from the ordinary citizens enjoying a drink and a night out but everybody knows that no one will be safe until one of the sides is through. Suddenly, the officers walk into the center of the room. One of them, with a few donut crumbs on his shirt, speaks up to the crowd: â€œAlright, lets get this underway. Please step forward if you have evidence that anyone present is involved with the Mafia.â€�The Loungeis an exciting social deduction game based on the extremely popular Mafia and Werewolf games. In it, you play the role of one of the members of a town. You could be in the Mafia, and want to gain power in the town by eliminating anyone who stands in your way. You could be one of those townspeople, attempting to rid your beloved city of all dangerous and malicious folks. Or, you could have your own goals, and be one of the 22 different 3rd party roles present in this game.</description>

                                <description>Why Youâ€™ll Love This Game.Letâ€™s face it, most â€œparty gamesâ€� make the party lame. Even those that are fun at first have the appeal of warm cottage cheese after just a few games. Well my friend, that is all about to change. We designed a game that actually enhances social situations. Players donâ€™t have to pay attention if they donâ€™t want to and even those who arenâ€™t playing the game can be part of the action. Youâ€™ll laugh, youâ€™ll cry, youâ€™ll curse your friends for being such weirdos. It's safe to say that Don't Be a Loser is totally unlike any game youâ€™ve ever played.Basic Gameplay.Players take turns rolling the special 10-sided die to determine who they'll face-off against in a 1-on-1 challenge. There are 26 different types of challenges, each of which is highly interactive and provides large doses of entertainment value for all. After the challenge type is read aloud all players who arenâ€™t competing get to bet on who they think will win the challenge. Monkey business, horse play and all around insanity ensues. This game creates hysterical moments that youâ€™ll talk about for days.The Goal of the Game.The goal of the game is simple: to become the Big Winner, but more importantly, to NOT be the Big Loser. Players all start in the middle of the board. As you win challenges and bets you move right toward the Big Winner square. As you lose you move backward toward the Big Loser square. The game ends when a player proves themselves to be the most pathetic by reaching the Big Loser square. Whoever is in the lead instantly becomes the Big Winner. Easy peasy.The Exciting Twist.Before the game begins players decide on a penalty that the Big Loser has to pay at the end of the game. Depending on how sick and twisted your friends are this can get interesting. The Big Loser might have to do something simple like wash the dishes or maybe sing a silly song about how grand of a loser they are. If this seems a little tame (lame) than feel free to go nuts with this, it's your call. Not to worry if you donâ€™t happen to be a particularly creative bunch, we provide 100+ penalty ideas of varying ridiculousness.</description>

                                <description>The Premise is Simple. The Strategy is Schadenfreude.Schadenfreude(noun) - enjoyment obtained from the troubles of othersAs the â€œguesserâ€�, you must guess whether the next number card is higher or lower while using the cards in your hand to either help yourself or hurt your opponents. But watch out! Your opponents can also play cards and steal cards to change your odds.The round starts with four face down cards. You win by being the player to correctly guess the last remaining card. Here's the tricky part: only one player can be the guesser and each time there is an incorrect guess the guesser rotates one spot to the left!InHogger Logger, you must know when to swine-and-dine your opponents and when to cut them down. Make your guess, knock on wood, and go hog wild in this exciting game of highs and lows.</description>

Players rapidly create endings to funny situations in this 4-to-8 player party game. Each situation lasts 10 seconds, and players get to play simultaneously (i.e. no downtime!).One player plays as the host, rapidly announcing random situations. The first player to create a valid ending to the situation wins the point. If more than one player answers, the host picks his favorite!Below is an example on our prototype cards, with 3 random cards lined up to form a situation. I might answer:"I Feel Panicked At The Beach Because I Saw A Man-Eating Shark!"What would your ending be? That's just one of 150,000+ situations from our 55-card deck.</description>

                                <description>Funemployedis a card based party game that is best enjoyed with three or more people. By using several Qualification Cards to form a resume, players compete with one another in order to be hired for a job that an employer needs to fill. To do so, players must create a story using their qualifications to explain why theyâ€™re the best for the job. The employer then has to decide which applicant to hire for the job.The jobs inFunemployedare all real world jobs that anyone could apply to â€“ things like a Mime or Celebrity Impersonator. The qualifications, however, are usually things you wouldnâ€™t say in an interview â€“ like how you have a pet Dragon to help convince people of your point of view, or how your Social Media Profile will be useful for spreading your brand. The only restriction to how you use your qualifications is your imagination!So, for example, an applicant may have to apply to be an Astronaut using nothing but qualifications like: a Magic Wand, a Million Dollar Smile, and Soft Hands. It is then up to the applicant to craft a story as to why those qualifications are best for the job heâ€™s applying to.Using the example above, that applicant may say something like: â€œIâ€™d be a great astronaut because my Magic Wand can save us from any space shuttle malfunction, my Soft Hands will steer the ship toward its course, and when we land, my Million Dollar Smile will win over the press and my adoring fans.â€�The applicant that best convinces the employer that he should have the position wins the round and the job he applies to, and the game progresses to the next job, employer and applicants.The game ends when the â€œMy Jobâ€� card is pulled from the jobs cards â€“ in which, for the final round, players must apply to the employerâ€™s real life job! The winner is the player with the most job cards when the game ends.</description>

                                <description>The king is holding a great banquet for all the nobles in the realm so that they can bathe in his splendour. Artists and troubadours will bring the necessary entertainment. It is meant to be a feast that will long be remembered!The guests attending the feast hall feel the same, for in the corners of the castle deadly plots are being developed. The guests are divided into two factions, with both planning to "dismiss" the king. One faction plans to smuggle a dagger into the feast hall to "open the king's heart to the realm" at the right time, while the other faction hopes to give the king "renewed motivation" with a poisoned drink.The Last Banquetis an epic, large-group game for six to twenty-five players. Each player takes on the role of a member of the Royal Court, from the King himself, to the pious Abbot, ghostly White Maiden, and courtly Baron. Acting out their respective roles, players must use the actions allowed to them to try and accomplish their teamâ€™s agenda. However, you must be judicious in your actions, as the King is watching closely for signs of disloyalty â€“ and not everyone at the banquet table is on your side. Court the Kingâ€™s favor, and work to enact your own cunning machinations to further your own ends.Featuring multiple scenarios of intrigue, teamwork, roleplaying, and bluffing,The Last Banquetwill have you cleverly navigating the intricacies of the royal court in hopes of securing your teamâ€™s objective.images Â© Fantasy Flight Games</description>

                                <description>A game of logical deduction, fraught with intrigue and suspicion!InMayday!Mayday!all players are flight crewmembers aboard flight LK-886, on which the pilot has suddenly died. A heart attack? Poison? Murder? The copilot must now take the lead, but other crewmembers distrust him. The crew believes there are infiltrators amongst them. But who? A skirmish occurs. Will all infiltrators get exposed?Each crewmember either belongs to the honest crew, or is among the few infiltrators who know one another. At the start you receive 3 identity cards, 2 or 1 honest and 1 or 2 infiltrator. The card you have double, determines your identity. You place these secret cards, mixed, face down in front of you. Then each player looks at 1 card per neighbor. By placing a knowledge tile at a card, you show (or perhaps lie about) what you see. You'll never see more than 1 of another player's 3 cards. So you must combine your own knowledge with the claims of others! But who can you trust?? In order to keep from being unmasked, the infiltrators will naturally act as if they're trying to deduce who might betray the crew.During skirmishes, some crewmembers will receive first the "Benefit of the Doubt", then they can graduate to a status of "Reliable", and then one of these two reliable crewmembers will become the new Captain. This Captain must start to form a final crew that excludes the infiltrators from access to the cockpit.With each skirmish, a player sees one identity card held by another player and shares this knowledge (but eventually lies). So each player knows cards self and must value the claims of others. With all players knowing different things, the deductive logic gets deeper and deeper as you theorize about who is who, while also holding possible lies in mind! Will you make it back to the ground safely?</description>

                                <description>Letter Jam is a 2-6 player cooperative word game, where players assist each other in composing meaningful words from letters around the table. The trick is holding the letter card so that itâ€™s only visible to other players and not to yourself.By doing so, each player gradually learns what letters theyâ€™re holding. At the end of the game, by filling in the blanks and rearranging their letter cards, everyone has to find the word hidden within these cards, still without looking at them.In the end, the more players managed to create an existing word, the bigger their common success!</description>

                                <description>Subtext has players trying to communicate with one another by drawing hints about the word on their card. Drawing well is not requiredâ€” in fact, itâ€™s a bad idea! - but rather just be clever in selecting your hints.Each round, one person is the dealer. This player looks at their word, then shuffles the card into the cards for the other players and distributes them randomly. By doing this, one player will have the same word as the dealer,but nobody â€” not even the dealer â€” knows who it is. The dealer then draws a picture, and you want to hint at your word so that ideally only the person who has the same word will understand what youâ€™re depicting. In the subsequent guessing phase, all players (including the dealer) guess which player got the same word as the dealer. Points are awarded based on the number of incorrect guesses, but the dealer and their partner have to guess correctly to even get points.How vague do you want to be in your drawing efforts to still get your message across without anyone else knowing it? Make sure your drawing has the right Subtext!</description>

So what if you have to toss a few planets into the black hole along the way?</description>

                                <description>Be the most wanted at game night.Most Wanted is a very simple western-themed game designed to rustle-up notorious friends and family around the table. All you need is a hankering to take risks, the guts to double-cross, and the desire to bluff a man out of his saddle. Most Wanted blends the strategic risk-taking of a wild-west poker game with the simple thrill of being a notorious outlaw. Playing the highest card - or bluffing with the worst - could mean the difference between a successful train robbery or spending time in the slammer. Players can repent at church to make a new start, or even work some honest labor (gasp!) for bail money. Be the first player to reach 13 points and claim the dubious honor of being MOST WANTED!Most Wanted is great for large groups because it keeps everyone involved at all times (even when itâ€™s not your turn). It takes 15 minutes to play with 2 players, and about 30 minutes with 8 players.</description>

                                    <description>Right Or Racist is the party card game that confirms and combats stereotypes based on data, studies, and general information. This game will spawn great dialogue and laughter, all while informing the public on interesting data.STEREOTYPES: Are they RIGHT? Or Are they RACIST?America is a divided country. One side claims that America has become too racist, sexist and hateful, while the side says people have become too sensitive and politically correct.I created this game to help shed some light on the truth, and try to determine once and for all, what is right and what is racist. I hope that this game becomes a tool for us to learn about one another and ourselves, engage in useful dialogue, and most importantly, to laugh at ourselves.</description>

                                    <description>Get ready to be doubled over with laughter with this ridiculous mouthpiece challenge game! TheSpeak Outgame brings friends and family together for laugh-out-loud fun as players try to say different phrases while wearing a mouthpiece that won't let them shut their mouth. In theSpeak Outgame, players draw from the deck and read the phrase as best as they can, but it's not so easy to do when the mouthpiece is hindering them from forming words correctly. The timer counts down as players try to say phrases such as "he's my stealthy pet ferret name Garrett", "slow down, you careless clown", or "pelicans love pollywog falafels." The laughter continues as players try to decipher what in the world their teammate is trying to say, and must correctly guess the phrase in order to earn the card. The team with the most cards at the end of the game wins. TheSpeak Outgame includes 200 double-sided cards, 10 mouthpieces, and a timer.</description>

                                    <description>Unusual Suspectsis a party game for up to sixteen players. One person was the Witness to a crime. They know who the culprit is but can only answer â€œYesâ€� or â€œNoâ€� to questions about the personality of the suspect. The rest of the team are Detectives trying to make sure the right person gets locked up from a line up of twelve suspects. They will flip Question cards for the Witness to answer, and then do their best to interpret the response. Based on their deductions they'll eliminate suspects until only the guilty party remains...or they let the perp walk. How well do you know the Witness? How will they respond? Has the culprit ever been to a county fair? Your investigation will have to find out!</description>

What about â€œGorilla Cyborg Force Overdriveâ€�?Channel A is a party game in which you create and pitch ridiculous anime series and convince the other players that they really want to watch them! Create shows based on random words in your hand, and vote for your favorites. The Alpha Genesis edition includes everything you need to playâ€“250+ title cards, 112 premise cards, and more! Already have a copy of the first edition? This one includes about 70 new cards, including new and updated chibi to inspire your show ideas.Ready your kaiju, magical girls, and secret ninjas and tune in for an evening of hilarious fun!Originally published in 2012 by Asmadi Games, now Evil Hat is republishing the game. EHP launched Channel A with a Kickstarter, and the game is getting an upgrade in the form of new art (by Dawn Davis, the same artist, who has improved her skills considerably over the past 6 years or so) and around 70 new cards (with Clay Gardner doing the logo designs for the new Title Cards). Weâ€™re calling this new version the â€œAlpha Genesis Edition,â€� and hopefully new and old fans of Channel A will find a lot to like in what weâ€™ve changed and added. (Also: more normal cardstock!)</description>

Each player wears a color clip that matches color voting cards. Players secretly vote on who is most likely to do what by casting the matching cards into voting boxes - so nobody ever knows who votes for whom. When each question has been voted upon, it's time to discover what the group thinks of you. Do you think you got the most votes? Some votes? or none at all. Don't be deceived by what you think of yourself - it's what the others think that counts! Collect points for guessing correctly. The player with the highest score wins the game.</description>

He argued that the fever alone was responsible for his nightly phantasies, and that when the touch abated he would be free from the monstrous visions. Those visions, however, were of abhorrent vividness and convincingness, and whenever he awaked he retained a vague sense of having undergone much more than he remembered.â€“H.P.

                                            <description>Do you have what it takes to be a deep space colonist? An alien frontier awaits the brave and daring! This new planet will be harsh, but if you have the skills to manage your resources, build a fleet, research alien life, and settle colonies, the world can be yours.Roll and place your dice to gain advantages over your opponent and block them out of useful areas of the board. Use Alien Tech cards to manipulate your dice rolls and territory bonuses to break the rules. Steal resources, overtake territories, and do whatever it takes to get your colonies on the map first! Don't dream it'll be easy, though, because the other players will be trying to do the same thing.Alien Frontiers is a game of resource management and planetary development for two to four players. During the game you will utilize orbital facilities and alien technology to build colony domes in strategic locations to control the newly discovered world.The game board shows the planet, its moon, the stations in orbit around the planet, and the solar systemâ€™s star. The dice you are given at the start of the game represent the space ships in your fleet. You will assign these ships to the orbital facilities in order to earn resources, expand your fleet, and colonize the planet.As the game progresses, you will place your colony tokens on the planet to represent the amount of control you have over each territory. Those territories exert influence over specific orbital facilities and, if you control a territory, you are able to utilize that sway to your advantage.The planet was once the home of an alien race and they left behind a wondrous artifact in orbit. Using your fleet to explore the artifact, you will discover amazing alien technologies that you can use to advance your cause.Winning the game will require careful consideration as you assign your fleet, integrate the alien technology and territory influences into your expansion plans, and block your opponents from building colonies of their own.

Its detailed instructional resources and intuitive interface will have you investigating in minutes, while its deep and engaging gameplay provides countless hours of eldritch horror.Note: whileElder Sign: Omensbrilliantly conveys the spirit of theElder Signdice game, a few noteworthy differences were adopted to optimize the mobile play experience:A limited number of available Ancient Ones streamlines the game play experience while offering adjustable levels of difficulty. Face Yig in easy mode, Azathoth in normal mode, or Cthulhu in hard mode (in-app purchase required to face Cthulhu).A number of subtle changes increase the peril of defending humanity. For example, the random negative effects drawn every midnight are more challenging, and the frequency of â€œno effectâ€� results has been decreased. Monsters have likewise been altered to make them more difficult.Finally, there are no Ally cards inElder Sign: Omens, which further streamlines play while increasing the overall challenge.Can you stand against the impending arrival of Azathoth?Store Links:(prices may have changed)Elder Sign: Omens HD for iPad- $6.99Elder Sign: Omens for iPhone &amp; iPod Touch- $3.99Elder Sign: Omens HD for Mac OS X- $6.99Elder Sign: Omens for Android- $3.99</description>

It includes offline solo (vs. AI) or group play, a tutorial, and online async multiplayer through GameCenter.Fealty is a tactical territory control game in which each player controls an identical set of units. These units are placed across the map, turn by turn, and at the end of the game they each claim area. Each piece claims a different type and amount of area, and some have special bonus abilities that happen when they are placed. It is quick to learn and play, but has lots of strategic options for experts.The tabletop version of Fealty was nominated as the 2011 Abstract Game of the Year by BoardGameGeek's Golden Geek Awards.Store Links:(prices may vary)Fealty(universal) - $4.99</description>

                                                    <description>From the green hills of the Scottish highlands comes a card game stuffed full of fun. The goal is simply to play all of your cards first. But beware, hidden in the misty crags are subtle strategies that require mastery of tricky combinations, wild cards and... "bombs".Sean Ross designed Haggis over a number of years, extensively testing over thousands of hands to create a very engaging and balanced game.The iOS edition was tastefully crafted to allow you to play 2-3 player matches of Haggis against AI players, with automated scoring and built in reserve mechanics to allow you to sort and manage your hand. You can play a short game to 250 points, or a longer game to 350 points--whichever suits your mood. And the great thing is the ability to pick up and continue play wherever you left off if you need to take a break, or get back to work.Store Links:(prices may vary)Haggis(universal) - $2.99</description>

                                                    <description>The Great Khan is dead, plunging the world of Eretsu into total war. The Khanâ€™s heirs fight amongst themselves for control of his shattered Dominion as the Durani Empire mobilizes to regain lost lands and honor. Their most fearsome weapon are Golems, arcane war machines created and mastered by powerful sorcerers.As the world of Eretsu descends into chaos, now itâ€™s your turn to take command of a Golem army and fight for honor, glory, or riches.Golem Arcanais a digitally enhanced miniatures boardgame that leverages the power of a smartphone or tablet to deliver an unprecedented and engaging experience. GA offers the richness and tactical depth of other miniatures boardgames without any of the hassles; the freeGolem Arcanaapp handles all the rules and record keeping, freeing up the players to concentrate on devising strategies and having fun.GAMEPLAYGolem Arcana is point-based army building game. Each player fields an army consisting of Golems, Knights (sorcerors who â€œpilotâ€� the Golems) and Ancient Ones (powerful gods that might intervene on the armyâ€™s behalf), and Relics (powerful magical artifacts that can be carried and deployed by Golems). Golems are represented on the game board with pre-painted figures, while Relics are depicted on game cards. Knights and Ancient Ones are digital characters obtained within theGolem Arcanaapp.Each unit has special powers and capabilities. The key to victory is figuring out how to best combine these abilities to unleash havoc on the enemy.The magic of the Bluetooth-powered Tabletop Digital Interface (TDI) Stylus keeps theGolem ArcanaApp connected to the action on the gameboard. Players move their Golems and launch attacks by tapping the appropriate game pieces with the Stylus.To Move:Tap the base of the Golem you want to move.Tap the square on the board youâ€™d like to move to.The App calculates movement costs, reminds you of the appropriate rules when necessary, and handles any necessary record keeping.To Launch an Attack:Tap the base of the Golem making the attack.Tap the base of the target.The App calculates line of sight, the chance to hit (automatically applying all the relevant modifiers), and expected damage.Roll the dice. (Or have the App do it for you!)TheGolem ArcanaApp regularly downloads new scenarios, unveiling new chapters in the saga of Eretsu and keeping the game fresh. Players can also use the app to purchase new Knights and Ancient Ones, giving them the opportunity to constantly evolve their strategies.THE TABLETOP DIGITAL INTERFACE TECHNOLOGYThe TDI stylus uses a tiny infrared camera to read microcodes which are invisibly printed over the top of the icons and values of the figureâ€™s bases and over the terrain art of the boardâ€™s regions. The TDI transmits the microcodes it reads to the Golem Arcana app (running on your smartphone or tablet) via Bluetooth 4 LE (Low Energy). For a list of known Bluetooth 4 Low Energy devices click here.TheGolem Arcanaapp streamlines gameplay by acting as a sort of referee. It remembers and adjudicates the rules and takes care of all the necessary bookkeeping. The app also delivers a few features that have never been possible in a board game before.Secrets and surprises unknown to any of the players might be sprung during play. Stumble across hidden information and secret quests. Discover (and converse!) with non-player characters who can alter the course of a battle.The fate of Eretsu,Golem Arcanaâ€™s game world, is entirely in the hands of the players. The rise and fall of Eretsuâ€™s various factions are dictated by the thousands of games of GA played all over the world. Each time you sit down to play, thereâ€™s a chance that your game will be a pivotal battle that will forever alter the world.The app makes finding and participating in Organized Play events a breeze. Players are automatically alerted to OP events in their area.One ofGolem Arcanaâ€™s important design goals is to keep your focus on the figures and the tactical situation on the board, and not on your mobile deviceâ€™s screen. The device acts something like a scoreboard at a baseball game, presenting the information you need, when you need it.images Â© Harebrained Schemes</description>

                                                    <description>Immerse yourself in an ancient Japanese setting and discover Onitama, an exciting, fast-paced strategy game! Onitama is somewhat reminiscent of chess and rather addictive with its dynamic game mechanic in which warriors face off so their master may win the game. Concentration and luck are the only weapons you'll have at your disposal! You'll need to fully master mind and body to defeat your opponents.THINK STRATEGY!Every opponent has four warriors and one elder at their disposal. The objective is simple: win the battle. To do so, you must either capture your opponent's elder or take their place in the temple arch. The game is easy to play, but you'll need time to become a true master. Although, not really... Onitama is the ideal strategy game for exercising your mind, as you'll have to think ahead about moves! The moves you're allowed to make are determined by five cards which are drawn at random, shown face-up, and shared between players. Each card corresponds to an animal and sets out a specific move that you have to follow. When you play a card, you must place it between you and your opponent and pick up the previously played card, and so on. This way, both players have the exact same chance of winning the game.IT'S ALL ABOUT ANALYSISâ€¦The key to success in this simple, elegant type of combat is to stay calm and concentrate. The Shrine of Onitama is a sacred ground where foresight is necessary. Animal spirits will guide you on the perilous path and allow you to gain true wisdom. In short, it's an elegant and simple game that captures the essence of martial arts. The game design and calligraphy will make your gaming experience a unique and unforgettable one.PLAY ON YOUR OWN OR WITH OTHERSPlay against the computer on your own, or against your friends.

It is also a roleplaying game in which your characters grow throughout campaigns, picking up experience points, upgrades, and new abilities.The game rules are very simple but they allow for complex RPG-like imaginative choices like teleporting to an enemy ship, hacking their helm controls and steering their ship towards a black hole before ejecting yourself out the air lock. Inside the box is an infinity of alien worlds to explore, rickety spacecrafts to upgrade, and a rowdy crew of lifelong comrades to adventure with.One player takes on the role of "the enemy", and works against the other players who are cooperating with each other.</description>

                                                    <description>Brook City is a cooperative miniatures board game of blockbuster cop action for 1â€“4 players, where each player takes on the role of a heroic police officer inspired by classic action movie characters. Gameplay takes place on a sprawling game board depicting the mean streets of Brook City, where players must use custom dice and their chosen cops' unique decks to race across the city, both on foot and behind the wheel (of highly detailed vehicle miniatures), to stop their chosen criminal's machinations and piece together clues to solve their chosen case.Brook City utilizes Adam and Brady Sadler's "Modular Deck System (MDS)," introduced in Street Masters, and focuses on quick setup and elegant, card-driven gameplay that allows players to customize their game experience by mixing and matching fixed decks to create truly unique scenarios.</description>

                                                    <description>Rum &amp; Bonesis a miniatures board game where players control fantastic pirate crews engaged in fierce combat. Inspired by MOBA style video games,Rum &amp; Bonesâ€™ gameplay is deep, fast-paced, and highly strategic. The game pits two pirate factions, controlled by 2 to 6 players, whose ships are locked in combat, with each crew attempting to board the enemy ship and disable it.Each shipâ€™s single-minded crew of Deckhands and Bosuns charge headlong across the gangplanks to attack key deck features on the enemy ship. These lowly crewmen are not directly controlled by the players. They form a constantly-replenishing mob of pirates charging towards the enemy, but the crews are evenly matched, so itâ€™s up to the player-controlled Heroes to shift the tide of battle!Each faction has five types of Heroes at their disposal: Captain, Quartermaster, Swashbuckler, Gunner and Brute. Each of these roles has its own general place in the battle. However, each Hero is still unique, with their own set of attacks, abilities, and reactions to crush the enemy or give their crew the push they need!</description>

                                                    <description>InArcadia Quest, players lead guilds of intrepid heroes on an epic campaign to dethrone the vampire lord and reclaim the mighty Arcadia for their own. But only one guild may lead in the end, so players must battle against each other as well as against the monstrous occupying forces. Through the branching scenarios of the campaign, the heroes gain awesome new weapons and abilities, and the game remembers the heroic deeds of players from one session to the next, unlocking exciting new possibilities in future scenarios!Arcadia Questis a miniatures boardgame for 2-4 players. Each player controls a Guild of 3 Heroes, competing to be the liberators of the city of Arcadia and, more importantly, becoming the richest Guild in the land!Arcadia Questis a lot like a World of Warcraft raid on a hapless NPC city, with Heroes working as a team, except that you're not the only Guild after the loot!images Â© Cool Mini Or Not</description>

                                                    <description>Bring fire and bring shell and heap all upon the pyre. With flame and gun we shall make an end to the withered husk that is human life. And in the blazing furnace of battle we shall forge anew the iron will of a yet stronger race. â€“Warhammer 40,000The shifting Warp Storms that surround the long lost Herakon Cluster have finally abated, leaving the ancient treasures and planets within this sector open to the rest of the galaxy. Now, the great factions of the galaxy mobilize their fleets and race to establish a foothold. The reward for successful domination surpasses all other concerns, and the price for conquering this sector will be paid in lives.Forbidden Starschallenges you and up to three other players to take command of a mighty fighting force: the Ultramarines chapter of Space Marines, the Eldar of Craftworld Iyanden, the Evil Sunz Ork clan, or the World Eaters Warband of the Chaos Space Marines. Each faction offers unique armies and play styles, but your goal remains the same â€“ to claim the key objectives selected for your faction. These objective tokens are scattered throughout the Herakon Cluster, but your opponents are sure to defend your objectives against you. Youâ€™ll need to build massive armies and command them in unending war to best your enemies and claim your objectives. The fight for the Herakon Cluster is brutal and bloody, and you will either stride triumphant over the bodies of your fallen foes, or they will do the same to you.Command Your ArmiesAs the general of your factionâ€™s forces in the Herakon Cluster, you have been entrusted with commanding your armies and seizing the crucial objectives scattered throughout the sector. To command your forces in the sector, you issue orders at the beginning of each round. There are four possible orders you can assign to your forces in the Herakon Cluster: deploy, strategize, dominate, and advance.Each order offers a different role for your armies within the systems of this sector. Your battles cause a constant attrition on your forces, and deploy orders allows you to conscript new units for your armies and build new structures. The strategize order invites you to gain new cards to tip the flow of combat or increase the power of your orders. Dominating a system allows you to harvest unique assets from your planets and trigger your factionâ€™s special ability. Finally, the advance order sends your ships flying through the void and your armies marching onto the field of battle.Even as you deliver your orders to your forces, you must be constantly vigilant against your opponentâ€™s plans. During the game, players take turns issuing orders by secretly placing order tokens, but you can freely place order tokens on top of any other order tokens, forming a stack of order tokens assigned to each system. The position of your orders in the stack determines when you can resolve these orders, making every placement a crucial concern. If you can outwit your opponents as you plan your orders, youâ€™ll be in a much better position to outmaneuver their armies once your orders are resolved. Order tokens and issuing orders will be explained in greater depth in future previews.Marked for WarYour orders give you the actions to field your armies and command them across the sector, but the planets of the Herakon Cluster truly lie at the heart of any strategy to lay claim to the sector. These planets host the objective tokens you need to achieve victory, provide materiel to build your armies, and grant you various assets to aid your conquering efforts. Combat is frequent and inevitable in every game ofForbidden Starsand every attack offers a new opportunity for glorious victory and valour.Combat inForbidden Starsis fast and brutal as battalions of warriors make landfall on planets and massive cruisers and frigates do battle in the void. Every battle is resolved through a combination of cards and dice, which provide different combat icons. While a battle rages, you and your opponent roll dice and choose cunning battlefield tactics by selecting new Combat cards. For example, the Blessed Power Armor Combat card has the potential to massively increase your defenses, while Fury of the Ultramar boosts your combat prowess and allows you to breach your opponentâ€™s position. Weâ€™ll explore combat and battles in much greater detail in a future preview.Even as you adapt your tactics within a battle using your Combat cards, youâ€™ll need to evaluate your exact goals for each battle. You can focus on destroying as many of your opponentâ€™s units as possible, or you can attempt to fortify your position and weather the storm until combat ends. A wise general knows when to pull his forces back and when to push the attack in hopes of causing maximum enemy casualties. The game ends as soon as one player claims objective tokens equal to the number of players, no matter the cost. You may decide that entire planets and their garrisons must be sacrificed to successfully claim your objectives.Each faction inForbidden Starsfeatures units and Combat cards unique to that race, meaning that each faction brings its own flavour to your battles for the Herakon Cluster. Whether you mow down your opponents with the World Eaters, build your defenses with the Ultramarines, rely on strength of numbers with the Bad Sunz, or outwit your opponent with the Eldar of Craftworld Iyanden, every faction has its own distinctive way to lay claim to the sector. Weâ€™ll also delve deeper into each factionâ€™s cards, units, and strategies in future previews!An Ever-Changing SectorThe wars ofForbidden Starsplay out against the backdrop of the Herakon Cluster, a recently discovered sector of space â€“ previously inaccessible because of its unpredictable Warp Storms. Although the chaotic influence of the Warp is still powerful in the Herakon Cluster, newly established routes have allowed you and your armies safe entry to the sector.In every game, the board is constructed out of twelve double-sided system tiles. Each system tile is further divided into planets and void spaces, and by choosing and combining these tiles during setup, you can ensure that every game ofForbidden Starsfeatures a completely new configuration of systems and objectives. Choosing which systems connect and where your forces are initially deployed also gives you the chance to start planning your strategy before the game even begins.Even later, once your armies begin to travel between planets, the unpredictable Warp Storms of this sector can greatly influence your armiesâ€™ movement. A Warp Storm on the board is placed on an edge between two systems, and while it remains there, it keeps any ships or ground troops from passing through. You and your opponents take turns moving the sectorâ€™s Warp Storms at the end of each round, allowing you to potentially close off your opponentâ€™s attack path or split his forces in two. Alternatively, cleverly moving a Warp Storm can open a new attack route for yourself, or defend your flank against an enemy counterattack.Glorious Victory Within Your GraspThe Herakon Cluster is rich with bounty. Ancient archaeotech, planets of untapped potential, and new converts to your cause all lie within this unexplored region of space. You have passed the Warp Storm barrier, but you are not alone. To claim the key objectives that litter this area of space, you must marshal your greatest warriors and set forth into the void. Will you survive and be hailed as a conquering hero? Or will your only epitaph be on a list of those who lost everything in the Herakon Cluster?</description>

Even Lord Fang ignored him after taking over the city, and the bad Doctor pillaged the cemeteries and mausoleums of Arcadia for test subjects. Obsessed with his experiments, Dr. Spider retreated to his secret lab and worked long hours to tease the secret of immortality from the universe, and to prove, once and for all, that he should have fame, fortune, and (most importantly) tenure! The accidental revivification of the Dread King to his mortal form was merely a side effect! Nothing to worry about. â€¦ Well, nothing for Dr. Spider to worry about. That's what heroes are for, right?Beyond the Graveis an expansion toArcadia Questthat takes place after the overthrow of Lord Fang.

                                                    <description>In a mad quest for forbidden knowledge and ultimate power, the necromancers have unleashed the apocalypse upon the living. Zombies have destroyed the Kingâ€™s armies, and now roam the land, spreading chaos and death. Is it the end? Are we cursed to die, huddled in our homes? Itâ€™s a dark time, but not for those with a will. Draw your sword, span your crossbow, and ready your spells! For the few, the brave, itâ€™s time forâ€¦ZOMBICIDE!Zombicide: Black Plagueis a standalone cooperative boardgame for 1 to 6 players that brings the relentless zombie-killing action ofZombicideinto a brand new fantasy setting! Players control a party of survivors as they fight to rid the land of an invasion of zombies controlled by the game itself. Survivors find weapons, learn spells, battle zombies, and gain experience. The more experienced they get, the more powerful they become, but the more zombies rise to face them!Zombicide: Black Plagueis much more than just the classic Zombicide game you know and love, transported into a fantasy world. While it retains the general Zombicide mechanics, several changes and additions were made for this new iteration.Black Plaguebrings a whole new breed of survivors to Zombicide, hailing from all walks of medieval life, and even including some fantasy races like dwarves and elves! Each of these heroes posses their own unique abilities to face the zombie horde, from familiar skills to all-new ones.Each survivor inBlack Plaguereceives a quality plastic dashboard to keep them organized. A built-in sliding arrow tracks experience gains, and plastic pegs mark wounds and indicate new skills. Finally, multiple slots hold all your cards, making the new inventory system intuitive and structured. Each cardâ€™s symbol indicates the slot where itâ€™s used. Weapons and magic spells must be equipped in-hand. Armor must be worn on the body. Special items like extra arrows can be stashed in your backpack. Survivors have varying equipment specializations, allowing them to equip a particular card on the body slot, and still have it instantly accessible.Armor introduces a new twist for Zombicide veterans. A survivor wearing armor (or carrying a shield) has a chance of blocking multiple zombie attacks with a lucky roll (although itâ€™s no help against the Abomination).The zombie hordes shuffling aroundZombicide: Black Plagueâ€™s alleys were raised by powerful Necromancers. When these dark masters enter the board, even more zombies spawn every round. But, instead of mindlessly chasing survivors, Necromancers will try to escape and spread more dread across the land! If theyâ€™re not eliminated, the avalanche of zombies only gets worse! The always terrifying Abomination ignores your armor, and is practically invulnerable to your weapons. Your only hope is to lay a trap of Dragon Bile in his path. Light it up with a torch at the right moment, and youâ€™ll see thereâ€™s almost no problem that canâ€™t be solved with the judicious application of Dragon Fire!Zombicide: Black Plaguecomes with dozens and dozens of incredibly detailed miniatures. Survivors have detachable colored plastic bases to help identify them, matching the color of the pegs on your survivor dashboard. TheBlack Plaguetiles create a rich and intricate medieval town. Street zones donâ€™t spread across multiple tiles, creating lots of twisting alleys for you to try and evade the oncoming undead. And if you find one of the secret vaults, you may be able to cross the entire map a lot faster (and you may even find a couple of very powerful artifacts down there).images Â© CoolMiniOrNot, Guillotine Games</description>

One player acts as game master, revealing the maze-like dungeon piecemeal as the players wander. Up to four other players take on a character (wizard, elf, dwarf, or barbarian) and venture forth into dungeons on fantasy quests. Plastic miniatures and 3-D furniture make this game very approachable. Expansions were also released for this system.</description>

This is where you can rate and review the game as a whole, as well as add general tips and discussions about the game.The Marro have been called to Valhalla to carry out Utgarâ€™s demands at all costs. However, hidden deep within the uncharted jungle, a lethal Marro hive is breeding venomous predators!Will the worldâ€™s Heroes be able to battle through the dark and murky jungle to defeat these savage creatures? Or will the Marro follow through with their mission to contaminate the world? The answers lie within the game of Heroscape.Heroscape Battlefields and Game ScenariosA game ofHeroscapereally begins with building the battlefield. YourHeroscape Master Setoffers several to choose from, and they can also be found right here on this website. Link and stack grass, sand, rock and water tiles to form cliffs, mountains, rivers, overhangs and more. The level-by-level pictorial guide makes building yourHeroscapebattlefield easy and fun!EachHeroscapebattlefield includes at least two exciting game scenarios. The scenario you choose will show you how to set up your game and explain the victory conditions for each player or team. Play them all, and then try creating your very ownHeroscapebattlefields and game scenarios!Gathering Your Heroscape ArmyOnce your Heroscape battlefield is ready, it's time to gather your army. In the Basic Game of Heroscape, the armies are pre-set for both players. Just decide which army you'll lead, then take those army cards and place those figures according to the setup guide in your Basic Game scenario.The Heroscape Master Game offers more choices for gathering your army. Choose your favorite Heroscape Hero or Squad figures, not exceeding the point total for that scenario. When playing a Heroscape Master Game scenario, you can either bring along a pre-made army, or you can take turns "drafting" army figures until all players reach the point total for that scenario.The Heroscape Battle Begins!Have you chosen your armies and placed them on the Heroscape battlefield? Now you're ready to rumble! The game ofHeroscapeis played in rounds. Each round is made up of three turns for each player. On a turn, each player will generally do these three things: 1) Choose an army 2) Move one or more of the figures on that army card 3) Attack with one or more of those figures.Heroscape Figures move, attack and defend according to the Move, Range, Attack and Defense numbers on their army cards. Battles are resolved by rolling the combat dice. The attacker rolls the number of attack dice listed on the army card, hoping to roll as many skulls as possible. The defender rolls the number of defense dice listed on the army card, hoping to roll enough shields to fend off the attack. If the attack is successful, the defender is destroyed and removed from the game.The Basic Game rules ofHeroscapeare designed to introduce the novice player to the turn sequence and basic rules of moving and battling. The Master Game of Heroscape features advanced movement and combat rules along with special powers that will challenge your strategic skills to the max!How To Win A Game of HeroscapeWhether you're playing the Basic Game or the Master Game ofHeroscape, each scenario has a victory condition. The first player or team to meet this condition wins the game!The victory condition may be as simple as destroying all of your enemies. While it's always satisfying to be the last one standing on the battlefield, you'll often need to do something more (or at least different) to win. Some scenarios inHeroscaperequire that one army be the first to reach a certain spot, find a certain artifact, rescue a certain figure, or survive until a certain round.images Â© Hasbro</description>

Six-ton constructs of tempered iron and steel slam into one another with the destructive force of a locomotive. Lead-spewing cannons chew through armor plating as easily as flesh.

                                                    <description>The Ancient Kingdom lies in ruins. For millennia, the continent of Arikania languished, isolated and enslaved by demonic elemental overlords, until the Ancient King sacrificed His name and destiny to bind them, free humanity, and unite the land. Though He ruled for over a thousand years, even He could not live forever, and His own scions have wrecked His legacyâ€¦The five factions of Wrath of Kings, like their founders, have very different views of what Arikania should be, and they have mastered different forms of technology and magic in their pursuit of victory. Each nation, lead by the scionâ€™s noble house at its heart, will change Arikania forever â€“ if they do not destroy it in the process.Take control of one of the Five Kingdoms of Arikania, ranging from the steam-powered wonders of House Teknes, the honorable stalwarts of House Shael Han, the mysterious followers of the Deep Gods, House Hadross, the monstrous denizens of the night in House Goritsi, or the cold and calculating killers of House Nasier.Wrath of Kings is a game unlike any before it, with games scaling from small skirmishes between players all the way up to massive regiments and battalions for a true war! One thing holds true, regardless of the level of engagement: youâ€™ll have to direct and coordinate your troops through powerful leaders in order to win- have your chain of command severed and your army will begin to crumbleâ€¦ Of course, the same is true of your opponent, so whether its victory through sheer slaughter and brute force, or the more subtle victory of assassinating your opponentâ€™s leaders, Wrath of Kings has a style for you!</description>

                                                    <description>TheYuggothmap is quite unusual. It adds three new areas with special powers.The Slime SeaThe faction which controls the Slime Sea overlook is allowed to summon the useful Slime Mold monsters, which are a good mid-level monster. The problem is that they obey ANYONE who controls the overlook. So if you have summoned up a batch of Slime Molds and another player captures the overlook from you, THEY take control!The LaboratoryThe faction which controls the Laboratory is able to use it to transform its Cultists into Brain Cylinders. The cylinders still produce Power like a normal Cultist, but cannot move on their own - they have to be carried. They also cannot fight or be selected to take a hit in combat. Instead, when a Brain Cylinder is "dropped" the other side can capture it. Now THEY get the Power from it.The Green PyramidThe Green Pyramid contains the mighty Brain of Yuggoth, which boosts your faction in many useful ways. However, during each Cleanup Phase the Green Pyramid's controller has to check to see if the Watcher of the Green Pyramid has been awakened! The Watcher is a particularly loathsome Great Old One who is the enemy of EVERY faction and, after destroying all units at the Green Pyramid, moves on a set path around the map wreaking destruction everywhere.</description>

Like the normal game map, it is double-sided and can be assembled in four different ways.It changes play dramatically. Each turn a Glacier piece appears in one of the polar areas and moves south (or north). As the game progresses the glaciers begin constraining the actions and movements of the players until everyone is forced to move into the equatorial regions, which naturally enough ensues in a bloodbath.If you like massive clashes and forced battle in the mid-to-late game (even more than in a normal game ofCthulhu Wars) this is the map for you!</description>

                                                    <description>TheAzathothexpansion is a unique "neutral" expansion. When you awaken Azathoth, or are the first player to summon one of the four Monster types associated with this faction, you get that unit's Loyal Card. This lists the Monster's (or Azathoth's) stats, gives his special ability (all Azathoth monsters have these), and so forth. From then on, only YOU can summon that Monster type.At least, until all of that Monster type have been wiped off the map. For instance, if you are the first person to summon an Elder Thing, then no one else can do so. You can summon all three available Elder Things should you choose to do so. But if all your Elder Things are killed off you lose their loyalty card, and if someone else seizes the opportunity to summon an Elder Thing before you, THEY become the new controller of that species.Azathoth is unusual in many ways. When he is summoned you choose how much Power you want to spend, and place a special marker on your Power track. This is Azathoth's combat ability - so the more you spend, the more deadly he is. Of course, in some games, a player fearing Azathoth's misuse might summon it cheap and dirty just to keep it out of the hands of another player. That's all part of the fun.</description>

                                                    <description>The Windwalkerfeatures a new and unusual faction, with Ithaqua, the god of Outer Space. His faction is most powerful in the late game, when his mighty army, fueled by his Sweeping Winds, Howl, and Ice Age spellbooks and abilities, dominates play. He also features the dread Gnoph-Kehs, strong monsters whose cost lessens the more numerous they become, setting up a feedback loop that forces other players to take note.Great Cthulhuis traditionally the most powerful faction in Battle, but a late-game Ithaqua has proven equal or greater than Cthulhu's wrecking squad. Players, knowing this, sometimes try to weakenWindwalkerin the early game, but he has proven extremely resilient. His cultists are immune to capture, his Wendigos appear for free anywhere a unit is killed in battle, and his lesser Great Old One, Rhan-Tegoth, is Eternal, and almost impossible to kill.Ithaqua himself is usually the last Great Old One to be awakened, but before that time, Rhan-Tegoth proves a useful and durable ally. If you are more interested in late-game prowess than early building, this is the expansion for you.</description>

In addition he brings out ancient sorceries, with monsters that appear for free on-map, burrowing their way up from underground, arcane wizards who are able to teleport to an enemy player's Faction Card and parasitize their special abilities, and the fearsome Formless Spawn.The Formless Spawn, a signature monster, have battle strength equal to the number of them on the map. For instance, if you have all four Formless Spawn in play, each has a Combat of 4 (which is huge). He has other abilities such as Cursed Slumber, Lethargy, Death from Below, and Burrow, all of which let him do more with less, making him the most Power-efficient faction around.</description>

                                                    <description>Mythis a cooperative game for 2 to 5 players developed and published by MERCS Miniatures. A complete game inMythis called a Story. Each Story is played over three Acts. Acts can be played sequentially, or can be split up over three different game sessions. Each Act lasts 2 hours.Players' avatars within a Story are called Heroes.MythHeroes are clothed in immense power, able to reave all but the mightiest foes. However, this power must be balanced lest the Darkness take too much notice. Players must weigh their actions against the Threat each will bring, with the consequences of awakening more evil and bringing doom on the party's endeavors. And be careful they must, as the Darkness is formidable and eager to snatch glory from the valiant.Mythis a fun fantasy romp where players feel truly heroic. In the playing of the game, the players are creating their own mythos. These stories are the ones carried away from the table, becoming myths themselves. And these are the myths, with friends and family, that we carry with us; telling and retelling our endeavors at the mead benches, earning treasured smiles and laughter.images Â© MERCS Miniatures</description>

                                                    <description>Season 2: Prison Outbreaktakes the players to an indoor environment with vicious close-ranged fights, Prison Outbreak contains all the needed material for a new player to enter the Zombicide universe, and lots of content, almost all new, for an existing Zombicide player to expand his game experience. In fact, Prison Outbreak holds even more material than the core game published in 2012 (now nicknamed Season 1)!ThePrison Outbreak will feature berserker zombies. Theyâ€™re really tied to each other. Prison tiles display tortuous alleys, small rooms and doors everywhere, filled with berserker zombies immune to ranged weapons. You have to think fast, foresee the improbable and jump into melee at every turn. This is like a modern dungeon where levers are replaced with switches to open or lock doors, use security rooms and reach secret areas.Prison Outbreakalso contains six new survivors with their Zombivor aspects. These survivors are really designed to act as a team, as their skills really complement each other. Theyâ€™re precious assets to any Zombicide team.Missions featured in the rulebook form a campaign on their own, as survivors battle to turn a zombie-filled prison into a reliable shelter. Many challenges await them, but they have new tools of the trade: riot shields, automatic shotguns, concrete saws and many more toys. Thereâ€™s even an alternate ending.images Â© CoolMiniOrNot</description>

                                                    <description>Blood Bowlis a combination of a tactical and sports game. The basics are extremely simple: two teams, one ball. The team that carries the ball into the opponent's end zone scores a touchdown, the team with the most touchdowns at the end of the game is the winner. However, itâ€™s how you decide to do this that makes things interesting, the ends justify the means! Itâ€™s not just the players you have at your disposal either. You can bribe the referee to look the other way as you cripple or trample annoying opponents and hire illegal wizards to give you a hand directly from the crowdâ€¦ Blood Bowl severely tests the finest tacticians' strategies.</description>

The party went long. Perhaps, a bit too long. For, when they all awoke after a drink or ten, theyâ€™d been banished! The sun was gone once more! And monsters stood on the walls and jeered.The Nameless' plan was simple: drug the enemy with strong spirits and bedazzle them with festive party favors. The Namelessâ€™s mighty horde descended from the mountains and piled the snoozing heroes beyond the gates. Eternal Night fell once again!Now, in this darker time within the darkest time, the heroes must face this despicable Nameless Threat in yet another Arcadia Quest!More monsters! More loot! More glory! (And, perhaps just a nice dinner party afterwards this time, hmm?)</description>

Heroes can discover and investigate secret rooms and rumors while the overlord spreads infection and brings a powerful new lieutenant into play: the massive troll Bol'Goreth!The two new heroes are Roganna the Shade, a Scout of unparalleled cunning and valor who has considerable willpower and speed at her disposal, and Augur Grisom, a healer whose very presence provides solace to his allies; after all, it's rumored that he can see into the future.In addition to new Shop and Relic cards, two new classes will enhance your character selection process.

                                                        <description>Across the land, courageous heroes delve into shadowed dungeons, journey to lost cities, and explore forgotten ruins. In the darkest corners of the world, these heroes confront deadly and terrifying monsters. For those few who survive, the rewards are many. For those that confront the Overlord, master of traps and monsters, in his dangerous dungeon realm and fail... only eternal darkness and the Overlord's hollow, echoing laughter...Descent: Journeys in the Darkis a semi-cooperative game in which two to five players will take on the antagonistic roles of heroes and Overlord. Up to four players will choose characters with a wide assortment of skills and innate abilities to be the heroes who will explore dungeons in search of treasure and adventure. One player will take on the role of the Overlord and will control the dungeon's many traps, puzzles, and monsters.The heroes' goal will be to cooperatively conquer the dungeon, seize its many treasures, and achieve other objectives as set by the scenario. If the heroes cooperate and achieve their goals, they will all win. The Overlord's objective is simply to use all the means at his or her disposal - from deadly traps and ferocious monsters - to kill the heroes. Each hero has a certain Conquest Point value to the party and if too many Conquest Points are lost through hero death, the party loses and the Overlord wins.Are you equipped and ready to step onto the Glyph of Transport and cross the dark portal into the world of Descent?images Â© Fantasy Flight Games</description>

Humanity is finished but the struggle continues. Which Great Old One will rule the ruins of Earth? Now, you take charge!Cthulhu Warsis a fast-moving strategy game about the end of the world. You take part of various monstrous aliens seeking to dominate the world. You can play as Great Cthulhu himself, or you can take charge of the other factions, such as the slither hordes of the Crawling Chaos, or the insane minions of the Yellow Sign.The game has a huge map of Earth to fight over, and 72 high-quality figures, all drawn from the dread Cthulhu Mythos, including Cthulhu himself, Cultists, Shoggoths, and many other horrors. Weâ€™ve designed these figures to 28mm scale, compatible with many other tabletop games.Earn and cast spells and summon monsters unique to your own Faction. Each Faction is strikingly different in tactics and techniques. A strategy that works for the Black Goat will be ineffective for the Crawling Chaos. The game is for 2-4 players, and up to 8 with the expansions. Each Faction has multiple unique strategies for winning, soCthulhu Warshas incredible depth and replay value.Cthulhu Warsis a combination of strategic gaming and Lovecraftian horror, with the bonus of high-quality monster figures to make your game even more fun.</description>

However, a band of heroes have rediscovered a legendary ship that may be the turning point in the battles to come. Raise the sails, batten down the hatches, and set sail for the Sea of Blood!The Sea of Bloodfeatures the return of the popular Advanced Campaign mode first introduced in the Road to Legend expansion. The Advanced Campaign allows a party of heroes to experience a series of adventures as one continuous story, culminating in an epic battle with the overlord himself.Sailing across the lands of Torue Albes, the heroes explore exotic islands, dig up buried treasures, and engage in fierce ship-to-ship battles with the forces of the overlord! Theyâ€™ll man the cannons, steer the ship, and swing across on the ropes to board enemy ships, while deadly Daggertooth Sharks circle in the waters below. The heroes keep the skills and items they acquire during each adventure, allowing them to face progressively harder challenges and deadlier foes. However, the heroes wonâ€™t be the only ones increasing in power â€“ the overlord will also gain strength over time, coming ever closer to achieving his own nefarious goals!</description>

The object of the game is to have the highest remaining Morale when an opposing warband's Morale has been reduced to 0 or below, or if a player ends his or her turn with no creatures on the battlefield.As a player, you take on the role of a commander, sending a warband to battle the forces arrayed against you. You recruit troops and deploy them on the battlefield. You issue orders to those creatures, outfit them with spells and equipment, and direct their tactics to break the morale of your enemies and drive them from the field.Dungeon Command: Heart of Cormyrincludes twelve miniatures, such as a ranger, a cleric, a knight, defenders, and archers. While each Dungeon Command faction is meant to be played by a single player, quick-start rules allow two players to engage in a shortened version of the game using only one box. Dungeon Command is designed for two players, although up to four can play with a few adjustments explained under the advanced rules.</description>

To secure power in the Seven Kingdoms and to ensure the survival of their lines, the Houses of Westeros each follow very different paths. Some forge strategic alliances, some create complex political intrigues, and still others use deceit and betrayal. But there is no more direct or lasting path to power than taking to the field of battle.InBattles of Westeros, two players recreate the military conflicts set in George R.R. Martinâ€™sA Song of Ice and Fireseries, taking part in battles directly from the books... or designing their own. In this epic board game of battlefield tactics, players control either House Stark, the wards of Winterfell who have called their hearty allies to defend their honor and lands, or House Lannister, an aggressive force funded by Casterly Rockâ€™s endless supply of gold.</description>

Better known as D-Day, the 6th marked the beginning of Operation Overlord, the Allied battle plan coordinating major offensive against German forces at Normandy, France. Here, on the beaches of Normandy, the Allies would either gain the foothold they needed to bring down the German war machine, or suffer devastating defeat.The Normandy Campaign Expansion expands the Tide of Iron base game by allowing players to recreate Allied beach landings against fortified German defenses. Players can also push past the beaches into the bocage, where soldiers fight in the dense hedgerows of the countryside.The Normandy Campaign Expansion also includes: Eight new scenarios including four linked campaign scenarios Over 100 new cards including Weather and Leadership decks New geomorphic terrain boards and overlays such as beach and bunkers New AFVs, including the American M-10, and the German StuGIII, Jagdpanzer IV, King Tiger, and Panther.</description>

                                                        <description>After almost two years of development, the long-awaitedTide of Iron: Stalingradcampaign is finished. Youâ€™ll get a big, hefty box that contains a wealth of goodies for yourTide of Ironseries including:Twelve new double-sided mapboards featuring the devastated terrain of Stalingrad.Three die-cut sheets of map overlays, markers, and tokens.Seventy-two Soviet infantry figures with sixteen squad bases.Ten Soviet tanks, including the brand-new T-70 light tank.Eight German armored vehicles.Five new Strategy decks.Twelve new Operations cards, including the stats for the German sIG 33b assault gun.A four-scenario campaign game.Stalingrad tokensIn addition to the physical components of the expansion, weâ€™ve also added all the rules you need to playTide of Ironscenarios in the dense urban terrain of war-torn cities such as Stalingrad, Caen, or Berlin. There are rules for movement and combat within multi-level buildings. Below, you can see the example of play that we created to explain how LOS works with multi-level buildings and other terrain. Each new rule that weâ€™ve presented includes examples of play to make sure that theyâ€™re easy to understand and can add tactical detail to your games.Of course, once you have multi-level buildings, youâ€™ll want to blow them up, right? Thatâ€™s why weâ€™ve added rules for destroying buildings in an urban environment. These rules are based on the destructible buildings rules from the TOI: Normandy Campaign expansion, but have been modified to handle larger heavily-built factories and apartment buildings. In addition, weâ€™ve added the sIG 33b assault gun, a German bunker-buster which fires the Stielgranate 42 round, which gives a +6 to attacks against buildings. Yeah, thatâ€™s right: a +6. Weâ€™ve also included rules for setting and spreading fires.Please keep in mind, though, that we have not actually changed any of the core rules from theTOIbase game orNormandyexpansion. These new rules supplement those rules, not replace them. Thus, you still use theNormandybuildings rules when playing scenarios set in rural areas, but switch to theStalingradrules for combat in major cities.Finally, weâ€™ve added four new specializations: Cavalry, SMG units, Commissars, and Soviet Assault Engineers. There is also a new type of token that can be added to a squad: the restriction token. A restriction token is a limitation to a squad that persists until the squadâ€™s owner removes it in some way. The two restrictions in Stalingrad are â€œStarvingâ€� and â€œUnarmed,â€� which help simulate the hardships experienced by both sides in the battle.</description>

                                                        <description>Dark Future is a 1988 alternate history and post-apocalyptic science-fantasy miniature wargame by Games Workshop. It is set in the then-future year of 1995 (later updating the setting to 2021), in a post-apocalyptic fantasy-inspired alternate reality where the United States of Americaâ€”as well as the rest of the worldâ€”has fallen apart. Society has collapsed (almost back to the times of both the Dark Ages and the Wild Westâ€”where there's no law and no order), and the natural laws of physics have broke down. Megacorps are now in total control, technology runs rampant, and Sanctioned Ops patrol the roads and highways tracking down and destroying the renegade scum who live there, outside of the law and doing what they please.</description>

The galactic conflict has risen to its climax. The Warmasterâ€™s ruinous legions have assaulted Holy Terra itself, the Emperorâ€™s seat. Here the fate of humanity hangs in the balance during the greatest military campaign ever seen.In theHorus Heresyboard game, this legendary battle unfolds across the razed plains of Terra and in the frozen orbit above. Deadly fighting ranges from the Emperorâ€™s golden Inner Palace to Horusâ€™s flagship, the Vengeful Spirit. Taking the side of either traitor or loyalist, two players control either fearless Space Marine legions or deviant Chaos Space Marines, mighty Titans, Imperial Armies both loyal and traitorous, and a fearsome array of other units, including the Emperor and Horus themselves.An innovative order and initiative system forces each side to carefully consider the commands they issue to their troops. A dramatic, card driven combat system incorporates escalating damage, gives players the opportunity to allocate resources between attack and defense, and brings to bear the unique special powers of each unit type, from fortification-destroying Titans to the perverse daemons of Chaos. Brother fights brother, and the universe hangs in the balance!Horus Heresyincludes over 120 detailed miniature models including 10 plastic terrain pieces, and more than 200 cards to bring this sweeping conflict to life on a stunning map of the war-torn Terra.images Â© Fantasy Flight Games</description>

                                                        <description>For two bleak decades the Undead reavers of Count Noctilus have plagued the oceans of the world. After each raid, the Dreadfleet disappears into its lair as quickly and silently as it appeared, far from the reach of Man. And yet there remains hope. Captain Jaego Roth of the Heldenhammer has vowed to hunt down and destroy Count Noctilus and his Undead captains once and for all. With him sail the most notorious and cunning of the pirate lords of Sartosa, each borne to battle upon a giant warship bristling with cannons, organ guns and bolt throwers. At the stroke of midnight on Geheimnisnacht, most forsaken of nights, the Heldenhammer and her companions sail into the realm of undeath known as the Galleon's Graveyard. One by one, Count Noctilus and his vile allies move in to stop them.Dreadfleetis a boxed game for two (or more) players that includes everything you need to make war on the turbulent seas of the Warhammer world. At your command are two fleets of ships - the Dreadfleet led by the Vampire Count Noctilus, aboard his gargantuan sea-hulk the Bloody Reaver; and the Grand Alliance commanded by the Pirate Captain Jaego Roth, who recently stole the Heldenhammer - the pride of the Imperial Fleet, and one of the largest galleons to ever sail the high seas.As your ships engage in furious battle, it's down to you, the fleet captain, to make important split-second decisions. Do you bring all guns to bear on the closest enemy warship, or do you sail into position for a furious broadside? What happens when the warship catches fire, or worse, the powder kegs ignite? Exactly how much punishment can your warship take before it sinks without a trace? Are those Undead seagulls or flying piranha fish? And, when all else fails, do you have the courage to ram your foe, board their ship, and engage them in a duel to the death?images Â© Games Workshop</description>

The result is a tense game of skill, bluffing, luck, and lethal brutality like you've never played before!Kaosballuses exciting card-based play mechanisms to put players in the role of a coach, managing their unique, game-altering team from scrimmage to sudden death period to outscore their opponents. Players need to balance scoring and killing their opponents, using powerful cheating effects all the while â€“ as long as you have the money to pay off the ref. No two matches will play the same!Kaosballincludes multiple modes of play: traditional head-to-head, partnerships-based alliances, and "Maximum Kaos" three- or four-player mode; 30-60 exhibition games complete with a pregame draft for ringers and team upgrades; and league play with up to eight players and upgrades that stay in place from game to game, creating a unique sense of progression.images Â© CoolMiniOrNot</description>

The main differences between to the two editions areNext Wavewill have reformatted rules and quick-start scenarios to better facilitate new players' entry into the game, slightly reduced components (15 less miniatures 225 vs 240, and less dice 14 vs 20). No rules have been changed and this new core set remains compatible with ALL previously published materials from both Fantasy Flight and 1A Games.Review by BoardGameQuest.com &gt;</description>

                                                        <description>Your heart pounds in your chest and you are finding it very hard to breathe. The zombies are everywhere and seem quite intent on making you lunch. With so many of them, it's hard to tell if the scraping footsteps and moaning are down the hall or just around the corner. One thing is for sure, they are too close for comfort, you are almost out of bullets and your luck seems to have just about run its course!Zombies!!!puts you in the middle of the action as you try to escape the ever-advancing zombie hoard. Players must use a combination of wits and brawn to be the first to the heliport and certain escape. The only problem is, the zombies are everywhere, they appear to be very hungry and your opponents would really prefer if you didn't escape.The game, for two to six players, features and ever-changing map and an ever-growing army of the undead. Players take turns playing map tiles, placing zombies, running furiously, fighting and generally creating havoc for the opposition. Combined, this makesZombies!!!a different game every time you play it.images Â© Twilight Creations Inc</description>

                                                        <description>Raid and Tradeis a negotiation and resource management game for 3-5 players. The player who is able to enter the golden city first wins, and there are three different ways to enter the golden city:Become an expert: Reach 20 skill points.Serve the city: Fulfill three secret quests.Become a nobleman: Get the most possible character points.In each turn, the players can spend action points to do several actions such as moving through the city, raiding buildings, attacking other players, and more. Each player has a specific skill â€” mechanic, trader, electrician, bodyguard and medic â€” and has his own unique items to build; those items can be traded off against other items or resources.The board of the game is modular so that in every game you have a new map to discover. All over the map, the players find different buildings which they can raid. Each time a player raids a building, a raid card of this type of building is taken and read, which leads to specific circumstances taking place. The player will be made to make various decisions including important moral decisions! Upon resolving the various decisions, you will receive character points. The choices you make, for good or for bad, will lead to specific perks and advantages (or disadvantages) during the progress of the game. When raiding a building, you get resources (tools, scraps, mechanics, electronics, etc.). By combining these resources, you can craft items with special abilities. By doing so, you will advance your skill points.Every player also gets secret quests of the golden city. To fulfill these quests, the players have to spend the resources mentioned on the card. To fulfill a quest will not only lead the players closer to victory but also give them advantages for the rest of the game.</description>

                                                        <description>This is the classic game of tactical Starship combat set in the Star Trek universe (the original TV show), Players command one or more ships from the Federation, Klingon, Gorn, Romulan, or Kzinti fleets, sporting all of the expected Star Trek weaponry like phasers, disruptor bolts, photon and plasma torpedoes, and tractor beams. Also includes other weaponry not commonly seen such as drones (homing missiles).Players allocate energy and plot movement before each turn, then move all of the ships simultaneously. Weapons are fired at will during the turn (i.e., not plotted before-hand like movement). Ships have shields and armor for protection. When these are breached, various ship systems are damaged, potentially crippling the combat capability of the ship, and eventually resulting in ship destruction.</description>

                                                        <description>Sails of Gloryis a series of games that recreates naval combat in the Age of Sails (1650-1815). Based on the game system used inWings of Glory(formerly Wings of War), Sails of Glory uses miniatures, cards and board game mechanisms, with a special deck of maneuver cards representing the different movement capabilities of each vessel. The game will be supported by a range of painted and assembled 1/1000 miniatures.Players will choose their maneuver cards in secret, then reveal them all at the same moment. The card features arrows to be put in front of the miniature, then the latter is moved on top of the arrowhead. Several options on the same card are available depending on the wind and, with advanced rules, the sails used. After all ships moved, guns are fired from the sides of the miniature to targets in range.TheWings of Glorygame system has been modified and expanded to accurately represent battles at sea between the large sailing ships of the past centuries. The first series of Sails of Glory will be set in the Napoleonic Age. If the game is successful, in the futureSails of Glorywill be extended to cover other historical periods, such as the Age of Discovery, the Middle Ages and ancient times.</description>

Set in a steampunk universe, your job is to decide where to utilize your energy, a compound called â€œzenjinâ€� more commonly referred to as steam rock or steam for short, in your...wellâ€¦. steam titan. Steam titans are giant war machines manned by talented pilots who are part strategists, part engineers, and part navigators. They also happen to be the rock stars of their day. Using your pilotâ€™s special abilities, as well as cards that modify your weapons and the terrain, you decide whether to power up your weapons, bolster your defenses or transfer steam to your legs in order to move.Phases allow you to move your steam titan, attack the enemy, manage your energy, purchase cards, and keep your pressure from reaching the critical stages. Because the flow of steam takes time, you must think several turns ahead while also reacting immediately to enemy attack. Players roll one set of dice for attack and a different unique set for defense. Since you are creating a campaign against your opponent, and reacting to their attack itâ€™s best to plan ahead, but prepare a backup plan!</description>

Prior to WWII, never before in history had a conflict been fought by so many men over such vast expanses of land and so many different terrain types.Filled to the brim with new terrain pieces, new elite unit badges, and additional victory medals, this expansion also includes dozens of new game elements, including rules for North African warfare, minefields, big gun markers, radar stations, supply depots, airfields and more.</description>

                                                        <description>The Great Khan is dead, plunging the world of Eretsu into total war. The Khanâ€™s heirs fight amongst themselves for control of his shattered Dominion as the Durani Empire mobilizes to regain lost lands and honor. Their most fearsome weapon are Golems, arcane war machines created and mastered by powerful sorcerers.As the world of Eretsu descends into chaos, now itâ€™s your turn to take command of a Golem army and fight for honor, glory, or riches.Golem Arcanais a digitally enhanced miniatures boardgame that leverages the power of a smartphone or tablet to deliver an unprecedented and engaging experience. GA offers the richness and tactical depth of other miniatures boardgames without any of the hassles; the freeGolem Arcanaapp handles all the rules and record keeping, freeing up the players to concentrate on devising strategies and having fun.GAMEPLAYGolem Arcana is point-based army building game. Each player fields an army consisting of Golems, Knights (sorcerors who â€œpilotâ€� the Golems) and Ancient Ones (powerful gods that might intervene on the armyâ€™s behalf), and Relics (powerful magical artifacts that can be carried and deployed by Golems). Golems are represented on the game board with pre-painted figures, while Relics are depicted on game cards. Knights and Ancient Ones are digital characters obtained within theGolem Arcanaapp.Each unit has special powers and capabilities. The key to victory is figuring out how to best combine these abilities to unleash havoc on the enemy.The magic of the Bluetooth-powered Tabletop Digital Interface (TDI) Stylus keeps theGolem ArcanaApp connected to the action on the gameboard. Players move their Golems and launch attacks by tapping the appropriate game pieces with the Stylus.To Move:Tap the base of the Golem you want to move.Tap the square on the board youâ€™d like to move to.The App calculates movement costs, reminds you of the appropriate rules when necessary, and handles any necessary record keeping.To Launch an Attack:Tap the base of the Golem making the attack.Tap the base of the target.The App calculates line of sight, the chance to hit (automatically applying all the relevant modifiers), and expected damage.Roll the dice. (Or have the App do it for you!)TheGolem ArcanaApp regularly downloads new scenarios, unveiling new chapters in the saga of Eretsu and keeping the game fresh. Players can also use the app to purchase new Knights and Ancient Ones, giving them the opportunity to constantly evolve their strategies.THE TABLETOP DIGITAL INTERFACE TECHNOLOGYThe TDI stylus uses a tiny infrared camera to read microcodes which are invisibly printed over the top of the icons and values of the figureâ€™s bases and over the terrain art of the boardâ€™s regions. The TDI transmits the microcodes it reads to the Golem Arcana app (running on your smartphone or tablet) via Bluetooth 4 LE (Low Energy). For a list of known Bluetooth 4 Low Energy devices click here.TheGolem Arcanaapp streamlines gameplay by acting as a sort of referee. It remembers and adjudicates the rules and takes care of all the necessary bookkeeping. The app also delivers a few features that have never been possible in a board game before.Secrets and surprises unknown to any of the players might be sprung during play. Stumble across hidden information and secret quests. Discover (and converse!) with non-player characters who can alter the course of a battle.The fate of Eretsu,Golem Arcanaâ€™s game world, is entirely in the hands of the players. The rise and fall of Eretsuâ€™s various factions are dictated by the thousands of games of GA played all over the world. Each time you sit down to play, thereâ€™s a chance that your game will be a pivotal battle that will forever alter the world.The app makes finding and participating in Organized Play events a breeze. Players are automatically alerted to OP events in their area.One ofGolem Arcanaâ€™s important design goals is to keep your focus on the figures and the tactical situation on the board, and not on your mobile deviceâ€™s screen. The device acts something like a scoreboard at a baseball game, presenting the information you need, when you need it.images Â© Harebrained Schemes</description>

Players infiltrate an opposing MegaCon location, fight through crowded hallways, capture and interrogate employees, find important locations, and secure the mission objectives.The office where the game takes place is created using double-sided modular boards. The modular nature of the game board lends itself to dozens of different floor-plans providing a new experience every time. The tight corridors of the office deliver incredible tension.

                                                        <description>From the Battle of Britain in the summer and fall of 1940, to the air bombing raids deep into Nazi territory and over Japanese cities in mid-1945 - the airplanes, pilots and the men and women who kept them flying, all had a profound impact on the outcome of the War and the bitterly fought ground battles thousands of feet beneath them.The painted airplane miniatures that come with this expansion and the Air rules that accompany them invite you to climb in your seat, strap on your harness and take to the skies! Equipped with them, you will relive all the battles you've played to date, but with a twist; this time around, you will experience first-hand of how different a fight can be, when seen and fought from the skies!</description>

You can even upgrade your troopers by collecting equipment and new weapons from the Battlefield, such as Machineguns, medipacks, grenades and more. But beware â€“ you could be triggering a booby trap!Featuring beautiful models from some of the most talented sculptors in the world,Deadzonemarries the frantic action and fun of a tabletop game with the simplicity and elegance of a board game to create a truly innovative experience. With the Deadzone box, players take control of either the stalwart Enforcers or the horrific Plague, battling it out over scarce resources by combining deadly actions and an innovate Battle Card deck to lethal effect. Shoot to kill or claw your way through flesh as it doesn't matter how many should die in this urban landscape so long as players achieve their objectives.All of this is set against a sci-fi backdrop brought to life using a grid-based gaming mat depicting the urban warzone that can be built up using Barricades and Buildings from the new modular Mantic Scenery Range, adding a vertical dimension to your games. No two games need ever be the same!</description>

                                                        <description>Chaostleis a unique game in that it combines the fun of tabletop miniatures gaming and conventional board games. The structured multi-level castle game board provides many levels of strategy. The simplified and exciting battle system allows this game to be enjoyed by heavy game players as well as those who are new to miniature games.Chaostlehas many levels of strategy from picking your starting army to moving throughout the multi-level castle towards victory. A game with pure strategy, however, would be just another chess game and not like real life where nothing ever goes as planned. Therefore, chaostle has many fates that constantly effect the game ranging from mild setbacks to cataclysmic earthquakes. These unpredictable twists of fate can be either from the card of happiness or the card of doom.Chaostlefeatures 23 three-dimensional castle walls that are secured onto the game board. The fantasy fighters can move any direction throughout the castle including up and down stairways to change levels. The castle sections were originally sculpted by Bruce Hirst of Hirst Arts.The game comes standard with sixteen collectible plastic miniature characters. Additional characters will be available and released in the future as add-ons to the game that will be sold separately. The first set of eight add-on characters will be available soon after the release of the game. Adding new characters to the game adds to the strategy and variety of game play.Each character has a battle card containing the character's statistics, weapons, special skills and upgrades. The battle cards have holes where pegs are inserted to allow for easy tracking of the statistics and upgrades.</description>

                                                        <description>Batmanâ„¢: Gotham City Chronicles is a scenario-based miniatures board game where 2 to 4 players control the Dark Knight and his allies in their never-ending battle against crime through an asymmetrical and open game system.Each game involves an action-packed fight where two sides face off. One of the players assumes the role of the Villain and controls the most notorious criminals of Gotham City. The remaining players take control of the Heroes, who must work together as a team to foil the Villainâ€™s plots. Each side takes turns, pitting their strategies against each other in order to achieve their objectives.Each game of Batmanâ„¢: Gotham City Chronicles is played according to a scenario which describes the plot, location of the action, setup of the game, number of turns, and the specific objectives each side is trying to achieve in order to win the game.The game involves two opposing sides: the heroes and the villain. We wanted to represent that dynamic up front by making it obvious from the art on the boxes. That's right, boxes, because one box will not be enough to fit everything you will get.But this separation has another purpose: it eases the setup of the game. The hero box contains the hero boards, screens, cards...everything the heroes need to play a scenario. The villain box contains the miniatures, tiles, dice, and everything needed to prepare the command board for the fight to come. These 2 boxes will constitute the core game, which include all the base offerings plus all the Stretch Goals we're hoping will be unlocked during the campaign.</description>

Ancient technology recovered from their first excursions on land has allowed these adventurers to develop new ether-powered dive suits and weapons and return to the bottom of the underground sea to battle with deadly marine enemies over powerful artifacts, glittering crystals and golden treasure on the seafloor.Players choose from four distinct forces to vie for control over the watery abyss, creating warbands from four to eight miniatures. Each character in the warband can improve after battles, giving the game an RPG feel, and players can even design their own characters, weapons and â€œether-techâ€� artifacts. DeepWars includes multiple types of scenarios, including exploration of wrecks on the seafloor, adventures in ancient cities of cyclopean structures, battles among fields of geothermal chimneys, submarine boarding and many others.Above all, DeepWars is about fun and fast gameplay, with scenarios lasting less than an hour. The rules are designed to be modular, so they are easy to learn but have enough complexity that players can game in a variety of styles. Players might choose to blast their opponents, stealthily sneak into ruins to steal artifacts, or wield magic spells to control the minds of their foes, whatever it takes to salvage the treasures of the deep.</description>

                                                            <description>In the not too distant future, the once sprawling metropolises of man are now nothing but dust. Wars, over-consumption and the wanton destruction of his own environment has left the earth as a barren rock. Across these trackless wastes, gang fights gang for the possession of scant resources, food and bitter glory. Move fast, stay in cover and watch your back. Outside of your gang is a short life of hardship and starvation followed by a quick, pitiful death.Nuclear Renaissanceis a tabletop skirmish game. The rules are for skirmish campaigns in a post apocalyptic wasteland. Players collect a gang of hardened fighters and souped up vehicles from the customisable range of parts and characters. Its a multiplayer game, so 3 or 4 player games work well in the system as well as the standard 2 player setup. Each player then pits their wits against friend and foe alike in a bid to win the coveted prize, to be the last gang standing.</description>

                                                            <description>The Cylons were created by Man. They evolved. They rebelled.After 4,571 days, the Cylon War ended with a sudden armistice. Peace lasted 40 years. But now the Cylons are back, as fierce and combative as ever. They want to exterminate what remains of Mankind. And they have a plan.The Twelve Colonies are wasted and in ruins. But the Colonial Fleet is there, to face Cylon spaceships and protect what it is left of Mankind.Welcome to Battlestar Galactica â€“ Starship Battles, the new miniature board game created by Ares Games, launching at the end of 2018.In Battlestar Galactica â€“ Starship Battles, players take control of Colonial and Cylon spaceships and face each other in furious dogfights and daring missions, piloting beautiful pre-assembled and pre-painted miniatures, faithfully representing the spaceships from both the Re-imagined and Classic versions of the shows.Designed by Andrea Angiolino (Wings of Glory, Sails of Glory) and Andrea Mainini (Sails of Glory), the game uses a unique game system, inspired by its â€œgloriousâ€� predecessors, but at the same time featuring many new features, to represent the cinematic, yet realistic space battles of the show.The game will cover both the classic series and the reimagined one that I would assume most people are familiar with. You can see some of the prototype ships above but have no fear as the actual game will feature pre-painted and pre-assembled miniatures for you to take to deep space with.They are looking to try and emulate the unique way that the ships fight in the TV show and hopefully bring that to the tabletop. We hope to learn more about it at Gen Con!Created by the same designers of the popular â€œWings of Gloryâ€� and â€œSails of Gloryâ€� game systems (Andrea Angiolino and Andrea Mainini), the Battlestar Galactica â€“ Starship Battles game will be first presented to the public at Gen Con 2018 (August 2-5, Indianapolis).Battlestar Galactica â€“ Starship Battleswill feature ready to play, painted and assembled miniatures, with a special base to support its unique game mechanics. Players will take control of one or more Colonial and Cylon ships, and face each other in furious dogfights and many other different kinds of missions.The game will feature innovative mechanics allowing players to simulate space combat using simple and intuitive rules to imitate the unique dynamics of the battles in the TV show.The â€œBattlestar Galacticaâ€� license agreement with Universal Brand Development includes both the classic series, created by Glen A. Larson in the late â€˜70s, and the re-imagined series developed by Ronald D. Moore and David Eick which aired until 2010.</description>

                                                            <description>Tainted Grail: the Fall of Avalon is an unforgettable, solo or cooperative adventure experience for 1-4 players. Blending Arthurian legends and Celtic mythology with a unique vision, it allows you to impact the game world in deep and meaningful ways.In a land slowly sinking into the Wyrdness and torn apart by conï¬‚ict; surviving each day is a challenge on its own. Starvation, sickness, violent weather, and random incidents all conspire to end your journey. Guardian Menhirs, that ensured safe travel throughout the realm, are slowly going dark turning simple logistics into an involving puzzle. To overcome these challenges, your character develops along several conï¬‚icting lines, such as Brutality / Empathy or Practicality / Spirituality. These traits unlock a rich choice of mutually exclusive skills and lead to diï¬€erent deck-building strategies, making character advancement meaningful and deep.The character you develop is going to be tested during dozens of combat and non-combat encounters. Sometimes you will need to brute force your way, but often diplomacy might be a better option. Regardless whether you fight with your strength or your wits, our unique dice-less encounter system makes resolving each conï¬‚ict fun and exciting, while keeping you immersed in the game.In Avalon, thereâ€™s a legend waiting behind every stone and every tree. All locations have their own rich stories and secrets to discover. Places and characters are often much more than they seem. As you slowly put all the pieces of the larger puzzle together, the land will always have a surprise waiting for you just around the corner. Many secrets can be discovered only after several games. Created by one of the best polish fantasy authors, Krzysztof Piskorski, the story of Tainted Grail: the Fall of Avalon aims to push the boundaries of non-linear narrative, building upon the rich experience Awaken Realms has infusing ambitious stories with excellent board game mechanics and striking visuals.</description>

The enemies and other threats are all controlled by the game itself, but you can play with a moderator if you want to.Gain experience and abilities between missions!Each mission has a defined goal, and the campaign has an ongoing narrative of mystery, action, and adventure.Each turn you each get to move + take an action - like piloting a ship or vehicle, or operating a weapon or medkit.Battlestations and Dirtside both use the same game system and are fully compatible, so characters and equipment migrate seamlessly. They are also both standalone.Battlestations: DIRTSIDE is both a board game and a RPG. It can be played - without a game master - up to 8 players, or played solo. It can also be played as a tactical skirmish game (player vs. player). It is a science fiction adventure on the surface of alien worlds.Features dozens of aliens species, multiple factions vying for power, and cloning technology. You don't need Battlestations to play.Your character starts with a special ability, weapons, and an ability for your species. You can gain experience, rank up, purchase equipment between missions, and gain new abilities. The action is fully contained in each mission, but your character growth is unlimited.Simple rules, and a tutorial campaign to learn advanced rules one-at-a-time.</description>

Iron Sky Hulks soar through the clouds hunting the next battle as their barrels heat up with Shells ripping through the air slamming and decimating heavy armour. Life and death rages on in the skies high above Targus, but will you, brave hero, be one who truly lives?In a far corner of the vast darkness of space, there is a planet rather unassuming but of great import. The fallout of a devastating age has left this planet, Targus, harshly divided between the sky-born, those who dwell amongst the clouds and those restrained by the cut-throat lands below. It is a land where magic and technology are blended and the norm, a world of horrors and terrors, yet single acts of wonder raise the hopes of men. Planet Targus Planet Targus.The sky born Valdians, are the Knights who were left to protect the skies of Targus. Entrusted with the lost tech of the gods, that now other nations jealously eye with contempt.The mountain dwelling Mals, exiles who were left to the North after their defeat in the War of the Gods, have been forced to survive in the cold tundra with little means to defend themselves. The cold tundra has left them as icy and steeled as their surroundings.The lofty reaches of the forgiving skies seemed forever out of reach to the forlorn Mals, yet fate had different ideas in store. A devastating earthquake revealed a long-abandoned shipyard buried deep in the mountain crags. The Mals quickly seized the bounty and set off for the skies never looking back.Hundreds of years of peace, up till now only breached by small skirmishes with bandits and renegades, would soon be broken. The last major conflict to shake the calm was the Commonwealth Rebellion, when a band of nobles demanded the Valdians share their wealth of ships and lands in tribute to the nobility. Although the conflict lasted a few years, the Commonwealth nobles were soon defeated and exiled. Born from the ashes of this conflict, the people of the Commonwealth and their new nobility have joined hands with Valdians to found nation of the Alliance, with the Valdians standing tall as leaders and protectors. The stage is set, and now high in the skies of Targus two nations are on the brink of war. The Valdians stand tall to fulfil their divine duty of protecting the skies, the warrior Mals storming from the stronghold to fight to the last for the future of their people.The stage is set, and now high in the skies of Targus two nations are on the brink of war. The Valdians stand tall to fulfill their divine duty of protecting the skies, the warrior Mals storming from the stronghold to fight to the last for the future of their people.Choose your side, the valiant Sky Knights tasked to protect the world, or the brutal Mals raging to regain what was lost. War is coming as hard iron hulks of the Mals blast through the pristine Sky Knightsâ€™.</description>

In this dark, medieval universe, kings plot for the throne of France, and on the battlefield their heroic knights clash with foes both real and legendary.For more than a century, from 1337 to 1453, the fields of France rang to the sound of constant warfare. The Hundred Yearsâ€™ War is one of the longest wars ever fought and is the source of many of our collective ideas about heroic knights of old. It was also a time of myths and legends, and a fervent faith in the literal truth of the doctrine of Holy Mother Church. It is this world of strife and faith that this game recreates.InTime of Legends: Joan of Arc, all the creatures that the medieval people thought were real, are real. Whether they are represented on tapestries, in stained glass windows, or in illuminated manuscripts, we take them at their word. It is this dark and epic universe that you will explore in the gameâ€™s many scenarios. Some are historical, with no taint of the whispered legends of strange creatures. Others are replete with the supernatural or (saints preserve us) demonic.You are free to control the army of miniatures that represent your heroes, knights and peasants as you wish in order to achieve your goals. You will decide who moves and where; whether your forces explore, pray, converse with locals, or simply charge into battle. But before we get to the field of glory, you must first choose your side.</description>
