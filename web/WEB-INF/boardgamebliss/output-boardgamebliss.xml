<description>You've conquered death and mastered all nine dimensions of space-time. Reality bends to your every whim and desire. You are the absolute best there ever has been, a necromancer at the top of their game. The only downside is that no one likes you on account of the creeping around with dead bodies and the lack of sunlight. But who needs friends when you can make them?</description>

<description>You are a formidable villain; your sinister conquests are innumerable. But there is one foe that even you cannot vanquish alone, Archerex, the lord of Dragons. A hoard of treasure beyond imagining waits to be claimed, and the scales of this dragon are more valuable than any amount of gold or gems! Will your loose alliance be able to take down Archerex, or will this great dragon’s rage consume you all?</description>

<description>Three-Dragon Ante: Legendary Edition is a re-imagining of the original classic Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons Three Dragon Ante, a casual standalone card game of chance for two to six players. Each hand, players ante gold to the stakes and compete to play the strongest flight of three cards, dragons, or mortals. The strongest flight wins that gold from the stakes, but playing weaker cards triggers your cards' powers and sets you up to win the next hand. This Legendary Edition includes new Legendary Dragons, Mortals, Gold and Platinum Pieces, and Ability Disks for combining Three-Dragon Ante with the Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons tabletop game!</description>

<description>This Adventure Pack introduces a new mechanic to the system - Plague. As if the horrors, traps, and challenges of the Dark Castle were not already enough to haunt the prisoner’s every waking thought, there is now a new kind of threat to contend with. As they explore the labyrinthine castle passages, players can now encounter Carriers, plague-infected lunatics bent on spreading the disease. Certain interactions with Carriers can cause prisoners to contract, spread, and even succumb entirely to this rampant atrocity, adding a new dimension and weight to the game’s risk-reward decisions.</description>

<description>This Adventure Pack introduces a new mechanic to the system - Companions. These characters can appear during a quest and join-up with the prisoners to assist in their escape. Fans of roleplaying games will know them by the term NPCs (non-player characters). Players will now encounter event cards in the item deck which trigger the arrival of one of the Companions. Each Companion has a unique mixture of traits and a special ability. They are powerful allies but their presence may be fleeting, so prisoners must choose carefully how and when to call on them.</description>

<description>This is the Fantasy Trip Companion – both part of the game, and a book about the game. It’s a very limited print run, made possible by supporters of the 2018 Kickstarter that brought TFT back to the world. It was a stretch goal in that campaign, and we appreciate the support! The TFT Companion is a collection of articles, starting with Steve Jackson’s original designer’s notes and errata published in The Space Gamer in 1980. It includes a collection of optional rules, expansions, and adventures created by fans for the magazines of the day, and closes with a collection of the articles posted online as part of the TFT Kickstarter in 2018.Features:38 years of history of a classic old-school RPG, from birth to . . .well, to rebirth . . .Includes Steve’s original Designer’s Notes!Plenty of fan-generated content, too!</description>

<description>Glorantha: The Gods War is a competitive strategy game in which 3 or 4 players (3 to 8 players with the Empires expansion) summon units (minions, heroes, lesser gods and usually one greater god); construct buildings (usually Shrines, Temples, and Ziggurats) and clash in mortal combat. The players seek to build their own strength and destroy their enemies by killing their enemies' units and capturing and destroying their enemies' buildings, to achieve Heroquests and thus earn gifts, and to earn runes with unique effects. Each empire has its own, and different, unique ability, weakness, greater god ability, units, Heroquests and gifts. For example, the Darkness empire features trolls, the Mistress (Cragspider), shades, and the Hellmother (Kyger Litor), while the Sky empire has archers, the Emperor, phoenixes, and the Sun God (Yelm). These are not just the same units with different names, but also have different abilities, as do their buildings. Chaos has both different buildings, three greater gods (the Unholy Trio) and a different agenda to the other empires. The game has a world-shattering "mythic" feel to it rather than a “fantasy adventure” sensation.</description>

<description>The King is dead! What happened? Nobody really knows, but he was found face down in a wine barrel this morning. It could have been either foul play or his own thirst that did him in. Regardless, the King is dead without any known heirs, so it's up to the five factions of the realm to decide who will be the new king: Will it be you or your opponent? Do you have what it takes to win over the realm's factions?</description>

<description> *NOTE: comes with Hunter Dice Bag and Player MatIn this fantasy universe, each player is the chief of a tribe of dragon keepers, defending the dragons from attacks by the evil hunter. The hunter wants to see those cute dragons dead, but must get past the dragon keepers. The keepers belong to different tribes but together they have the common goal of protecting the dragons. The keepers use magic in their duels with the evil hunter.Dragon Keepers was designed by Vital Lacerda and his youngest daughter, Catarina. Says Vital, "She is the one who knows a lot about dragons and I could have never been able to do this design without her." Dragon Keepers has two different games in the box:KEEPER GAME: 3–6 players | 10–15 minutes | ages 6+In this competitive mode, the hunter rolls dice to attack the dragons and the players choose which of the attacked dragons they want to defend. The game ends when one player manages to heroically defend three different dragons or if one dragon gets three hits. The winner is the player with more successful defenses.DRAGON GAME: 2–4 players | 20–40 minutes | ages 9+In this cooperative mode, the keepers work together to defend and train the dragons so that they attack the hunter. Players can take four different actions: Defend, Cure, Train and Attack. Those actions are limited and they need to cooperate and organized as a group to manage to stop the hunter's attacks during the game. The players lose if a dragon is killed by the hunter, or if the battle event deck runs out. The players win if X dragons (where X is determined by the difficulty level) manage to successfully attack the hunter.</description>

<description>Quoddria was a peaceful world, its cube-shaped inhabitants were generally happy and content in their seaside cities, quaint forest villages and even in their vast and deep and bejeweled cave systems. Then the sky began to fall and everything changed. Fire streaked across the sky raining disaster upon their world. When the fires and earthquakes dissipated and the sky once again cleared, the inhabitants of Quoddria emerged from hiding and began to rebuild their lives. Amid the fragments of meteors in the ruins of towns and villages, altered landscapes and vanished seas, the people encountered wondrous crystals. The inhabitants of Quoddria soon discovered that crystals had miraculous properties, bringing new life and unlocking incredible powers in some who encounter them.</description>

Each city-state competes to attract the tribes, eager for the strength of the combined peoples, who are now leaving behind old traditions with the hope that the titans can be defeated once and for all.</description>

<description>Queen Gimnax has ordered the reclamation of the northern lands. As a cartographer in her service, you are sent to map this territory, claiming it for the Kingdom of Nalos. Through official edicts, the queen announces which lands she prizes most, and you will increase your reputation by meeting her demands. But you are not alone in this wilderness. The Dragul contest your claims with their outposts, so you must draw your lines carefully to reduce their influence. Reclaim the greatest share of the queen’s desired lands and you will be declared the greatest cartographer in the kingdom.</description>

<description>In the region of Aqshy, even if your uneasy allies place their resources in the perfect place, your mutual enemies can be strong and unpredictable. You'll build resources to block your allies from developing their strongest options, and they'll return the favor. They'll weaken enemies and you'll try to deliver the killing blow. Each turn provides many choices, so you need to pivot as you learn the strategies best suited to your common enemy as well as your allies. One thing's for certain — whether Anvalor survives the siege on it or not, things are sure to get heated!</description>

<description>Direwild is a fully co-operative, tactical, dungeon-crawling deck-builder. There is no dungeon master; it is purely the players vs. the game. Players assume the role of animists, heroes that can summon creatures both great and small (represented in the cards you build your deck with), then combine those creatures in unique ways. With the creatures' help, the animists strive to work as a team to defeat the evil forces of Karn. Karn was once a great animist himself, but was corrupted by his lust for greater power. Throughout the game, Karn tries to hunt the heroes and defeat them before they can grow strong enough to face him in the final showdown. The game is split into three chapters, with a "game save" mechanism to allow for the packing and saving of the game between game nights.</description>

<description>If the Lannisters are known for one thing, it's their deep pockets. Their wealth lets them afford only the best when it comes to arming and armoring up their troops. Halberds tend to be a relatively cheap weapon to produce, but those made for Lannister troops are still of the highest quality, almost guaranteed to never break, even when receiving a charge from enemy cavalry. And receiving a charge is just what these men are trained to do, and do it well.</description>

<description>In Westoros, it's not just the men that will put their lives on the line out on the battlefield. Especially for the Free Folk, everyone is expected to do their part, and that's why the Spearwives units are created. But far from just feeble extras, the Spearwives have trained extensively with their weapons of choice, and can be just as deadly as any other soldier. Their short spears are light enough to even be thrown at the enemy, letting the Spearwives cut them down at range. But the real danger comes when they charge. Their sharp spears, with the momentum of a running start, can pierce even the toughest armor. Adding a seasoned Spearwife Matriarch to the unit only enhances their maneuverability.The Spearwives Unit Box for A Song of Ice and Fire: Tabletop Miniatures Game gives Free Folk commanders a new unit and unit attachment that they can bring to the battlefields of Westeros.Features:Highly-Detailed Miniatures - The unit box comes with 12 highly detailed Spearwives miniatures along with a Spearwife Matriarch figure, all in pre-assembled plastic.Mobile and Deadly - The Spearwives are deadly at both short range and in melee, their spears getting bonuses when used on the charge.Matriarchal Guidance - The Spearwife Matriarch allows the unit to Disengage after attacking in melee, keeping them from being bogged down in protracted battles.Contents:13 Miniatures1 Unit Card1 Attachment Card1 Movement Tray</description>

<description>Number of Players: 2+Playing Time: 45-60 MinutesRecommended Ages: 14+In combat, hitting the enemy without them being able to hit you back is a very powerful ability.

In that role, Crannogman Trackers are the unit of choice for Free Folk commanders. They are lightly armed and armored, but that allows them to be quick and nimble. The skill with their bows means enemies risk dying under a hail of missile fire. When joined by a Crannogman Warden, they become even more deadly, giving them a guiding hand to who to attack next.The Crannogman Tracker Unit Box for A Song of Ice and Fire: Tabletop Miniatures Game comes complete with everything a Free Folk players needs to put these harassers on the battlefield.

Though Stark Outriders eschew the heavier armor of many other mounted units, what they lose in durability they more than make up for in maneuverability and speed. Not ones to be bogged down by enemy forces, they can quickly distance themselves from their foes, ready to charge back in again on a flank.</description>

<description>Speed is often the deciding factor in combat. The one that can get in a good, strong strike against their opponent will be at an advantage for the rest of the battle. The swift Ranger Hunters excel at lightning-fast strikes. Using either their short bow or their trusty daggers, they conduct rapid raids against enemies. However, that speed comes at a price in terms of armor. If caught in a protracted engagement, the favor quickly tips against them.</description>

<description>In the far North, the brotherhood of the Night's Watch keep an eye on any terrors that would assault Westeros. They are the unwanted. The lower sons, the criminals, the bastards, the outcasts. But in the Night's Watch, they find a place and a purpose. Outfitted with rugged, warm armor and massive swords, they fight against Wildings and any other horrors with stoicism born of hard training.</description>

You have cards representing Night Terrors, and the more of them you combine in the right order, the more monsters will come to life, and the more horrifying they become. Create monsters that will make your opponents gasp in horror. Nourish them with your own fear and make them stronger. Only then will you achieve victory and become the Master of Terror!</description>

<description>Number of Players: 2+Playing Time: 45-60 MinutesRecommended Ages: 14+The bulk of the Free Folk forces are made up of the everyday people of the various tribes. They don't have fancy metal armor. They don't relentlessly train and drill maneuvers. They barely have weapons, just scavenging a bit of bone or old swords from the battlefield. But what they lack in military tactics, they more than make up for in one thing: numbers. When the raiders come down from the north, they're like a tidal wave, overwhelming enemy defenses as they go.The Free Folk Raiders Unit Box for the A Song of Ice and Fire: Tabletop Miniatures Game gives Free Folk commanders a new option for the battlefield. The unit may not have the best stats in the game, but that means their low cost makes them very easy to combine with any force. The Raid Leader Unit Attachment adds to their deadliness, allowing another Free Folk unit to activate directly after the Raiders do.Features:Highly-Detailed Miniatures - The box contains 12 pre-assembled Free Folk Raider miniatures and a Raid Leader miniature, all in highly-detailed and pre-assembled so they can be played right out of the box.Fielded in Pairs - As pack hunters, the Free Folk Raiders are always fielded in pairs of units on the battlefield.Strength in Numbers - The Free Folk Raiders aren't necessarily strong or fast or tough, but they're inexpensive for commanders to field and can easily overwhelm the enemy's forces by sheer mass of numbers.Contents:13 Miniatures1 Unit Card1 Attachment Card1 Movement Tray</description>

<description>House Bolton has the most-armored unit on the field of battle. The Flayed Men cavalry are clad in heavy plate armor and their horses are equally armored in thick barding. Only the toughest and largest horses can withstand the great weight put upon them by all that steel. While they might not be the fastest cavalry unit, they are certainly the hardiest. And their own war flails make enemy defenses seem pointless as the spiked balls wrap around limbs or curve over shields.</description>

<description>Dogs have been used as part of the hunt for hundreds of years. Their keen sense of smell, swift running speed, and vicious bite have helped man put food on the table since their domestication. House Bolton, though, has trained dogs to not just hunt wild game, but men out on the field of battle. Accompanied by handlers, whose arrows help slow their prey, the dogs are quick to chew apart anyone they catch.</description>

<description>A trait that is often undervalued in war is flexibility. Sure, an army needs its specialists. Ones who can lead a charge, or hold back an assault, but a Unit that can do a little bit of everything is priceless when they step onto the field. The Umber Greataxes are that Unit for House Stark.The warriors in the Umber Greataxes Unit Box are fiercely loyal to the Starks. They combine mobility, defense, and fearsome weaponry to make them one of the most versatile and deadly forces in the game. Many of the more traditional Commanders will find themselves unprepared for the Greataxes' tactics, and the longer the battle goes...the stronger they become.</description>

<description>When in war, a Commander must take advantage of all of the technology at their disposal. Minor breakthroughs can provide a slight edge on the battlefield, but when a discovery like Wildfire is made, it's enough to turn the tide of a conflict.With the Pyromancers Unit Box, Lannister Commanders will be able to take advantage of "the substance," a volatile, green, liquid that sticks to armor and burns the flesh inside. It is a powerful tool on the battlefield, but wielding it can be dangerous, and mishandling it can be disastrous to their own troops. However, it's worth the risks when they see the panic Wildfire can induce in the opposing forces. The Alchemists' Guild is about to make its mark on the war.</description>

<description> In the far North, at the very edge of civilization in Westeros, the Night's Watch tirelessly guard The Wall against any and all incursions.

<description>Though the Great Houses and their vassals play the eternal Game of Thrones, there are some who do not. The men of the Night's Watch guard the immense and icy Wall, built in the ancient days of Westeros to hold back the terrible things of the Long Night. Once a mighty cohort of brave knights and lords who gave up everything to protect the Seven Kingdoms from the predators of the Far North, the Night's Watch is now a rag-tag band of thieves, murderers, and those who ran afoul of the political machinations of their enemies. When the wildlings stir on the other side of the Wall, and the cold winds rise once more, will they be enough to save Westeros? Night's Watch gives you everything you need add this once noble order to your A Song of Ice and Fire Roleplaying chronicle. It includes rules for playing men of the Night's Watch and wildlings alike, as well as new information about the mysterious Others. Pray, men of the green lands, for Winter is Coming!</description>

<description>Once there was a pact between the humans and the Sentinels: Should the Oni reappear, the pandas will also return. Even though people have forgotten about this pact, the Sentinels continue to abide by it. But they no longer protect people, but life itself. So they return from the Jade forests and go into battle against the Oni.This new faction for Tsukuyumi - Full Moon Down wins the game immediately when there are no more Oni on the field. The Sentinels are changing the game a lot, so they have to adapt all players to this new faction and develop new strategies.Only playable with the basic game "Tsukuyumi"!</description>

<description>The Lannisters spare no expense when it comes to outfitting their troops. Even the regular line soldier has the finest in arms and armor. So, when it comes to a unit as special as their mounted knights, cost is never an issue. The Knights of Casterly Rock have literally the best equipment and training that money can buy. And they are worth every penny on the battlefield as they cut their way through enemy ranks.</description>

<description>In battle, the goal is to defeat your opponent without being defeated, yourself. If you can attack your enemy and they cannot retaliate, that goes a long way to victory. For House Stark, that means employing skilled bowmen in their ranks. They have trained relentlessly in their everyday lives as trappers, rangers, and hunters. Now, they form up and send out steel-tipped death to the foes of the Direwolf.</description>

<description>STORYWORLDThe future. Slowly but steadily, the Moon has been approaching the Earth, touched the surface and ripped a deep rift across continents, mountain ranges and oceans, until it came to a halt in the now dried-out Pacific Ocean. Chaos and devastation wrecked the Earth and its inhabitants - and grew even more in dimension when the Moon revealed itself to be a "kami", a Japanese God of old: the white dragon TSUKUYUMI. Exiled into the night sky eons ago, TSUKUYUMI has been roused by Japanese warriors, who tried to rid themselves off their godly creators. TSUKUYUMI'S time for revenge has finally come...Now, in the post-apocalyptic world, humankind is on the verge of extinction, whereas animal species mutated under the influence of TSUKUYUMI and grew bigger and stronger than ever. All those different factions are now fighting fiercely for survival, as well as for world domination.TSUKUYUMI is a no-luck boardgame, that demands specific strategic skills of it's 3-5 (6) players. It's particular appeal lies in the clash of multifarious, asymmetrical factions. At the beginning, each player picks one of the five factions. The factions bring their own respective abilities, units and strategies. Therefore the game changes depending on what factions meet on the battlefield.Values and abilities of the factions still don’t guarantee victory. Numerous test matches have shown: It’s the players who find new combinations and the right moments to use specific faction features, who notice their fellow players’ weaknesses and use them to their own advantages. This way, they shape their faction and bring the creatures and their stories to life. FACTIONSTHE NOMADS are the former soldiers who were stationed on the USS Nomad, an aircraft carrier that stranded in the wastelands. Armed, agile and patriotic as they are, the NOMADS try to claim the remains of the moon in the name of their (former) nation.THE BOARLORDS are a nation of strong and intelligent boars, who enter the pacific region from the former Korean peninsula. They aim to replace the human race as dominant species -claiming more and more land by terraforming it into their rampart-like homes.THE CYBERSAMURAI use satellites, supercomputers and artificial intelligence once developed in old Japan to control an army of drones, fighting bots and even an orbital laser system, threatening anyone who tries to plant their flag on the moon.THE DARK SEED'S nest grew in the wastelands as roaches and other insects became bigger and more intelligent under TSUKUYUMI'S influence. Their swarm grows rapidly - and thus they fight relentlessly to overwhelm adversarial units and territories by their sheer number.THE KAMPFGRUPPE 03 are the heirs to the Order of Marduk - and same as their spiritual ancestors in medieval times, dragonslayers Siegfried and Georg, they strive for a world unburdened by TSUKUYUMI'S existence.GAMEPLAYEach faction has its own units, its own strengths and special abilities - therefore requiring a very adjusted strategy to win.After the gameboard is set up, every player chooses a faction respectively. The faction boards explain in detail all special abilities and how to use them. It also specifies the factions' start set-up.According to the decending initiative order marked on the board, the players install their "Homezones", pick three start-areas and place their units.Prior to the first round, they also choose a white actioncard - a combination of actions they can use before the beginning of each round.Then, the players gather their resources according to what their areas offer. They may use these resources to bid on the blue, green and red actioncards. Every phase is represented by six of those actioncards marked from A to F. Every card displays a different combination of the actions that can be taken during its respective phase. The highest bid is awarded with the A-card, the next one with the B-card, and so on.Each round consists of the following phases:White Phase: Players use the white actioncard they chose to emphasise their strategy.Blue Phase: Players can rise in the initiative order and/or draw an Impact Card.Green Phase: New units are generated and resources collected.Red Phase: Units are moved, adversarial areas and units may be attacked. Onis are placed, moved, and used for attacks.GOALThe player who gains the most Victory Points wins the game. Victory Points are earned by conquering and occupying areas, and by fulfilling goals and/or the faction's respective mission.ENDThe game ends after the number of rounds determined by the players beforehand - usually 3-4 rounds.</description>

<description>In Quarriors!, each player plays as a Quarrior competing for glory in the eyes of Quiana, the Empress of Quaridia. Each player starts with an identical set of twelve dice in their dice bag. At the start of the game, creature and spell dice (dubbed "quarry") are dealt at random to form "the Wilds" in the center of the table. As play progresses, players roll their dice to attempt to summon creatures, cast spells, and harness the magical power of Quiddity (the in-game resource) to capture quarry from the Wilds to add to their repertoire and into their dice bag. Players draw and roll six dice a turn from their bag, meaning that controlling bag composition is key to victory.</description>

<description>From the imagination of legendary game designer Richard Garfield comes a game unlike anything the world has ever seen—a game where every deck is as unique as the person who wields it and no two battles will ever be the same. This is KeyForge, where deckbuilding and boosters are a thing of the past, where you can carve a path of discovery with every deck, where you can throw yourself into the game with the force of a wild wormhole and embrace the thrill of a tactical battle where wits will win the day!</description>

The board, illustrated by Franz Vohwinkel as well as many well-known American fantasy artists, consists of 21 large building tiles, which show building plans on one side and the buildings in their reconstructed glory on the other. As in the 2-player game, the game includes 3 large molded plastic dragons.</description>

Only the most courageous and adventurous Curse Breakers may enter the temples, break the dark curses, and bring back the arcane runes for the magic academy for its glorious bounty. Through teleportation, you can collect crystals of various colors from all over the world, and put them on your very own Crystal Grid in the correct order. Only then will the power of the crystals fuse together, and be powerful enough to break the dark curses inside the temples. Are you able to rise among your peers, and become the most reliable and professional Curse Breaker the magic academy has ever seen?</description>

<description>Direwild is a fully co-operative, tactical, dungeon-crawling deck-builder. There is no dungeon master; it is purely the players vs. the game. Players assume the role of animists, heroes that can summon creatures both great and small (represented in the cards you build your deck with), then combine those creatures in unique ways. With the creatures' help, the animists strive to work as a team to defeat the evil forces of Karn. Karn was once a great animist himself, but was corrupted by his lust for greater power. Throughout the game, Karn tries to hunt the heroes and defeat them before they can grow strong enough to face him in the final showdown. The game is split into three chapters, with a "game save" mechanism to allow for the packing and saving of the game between game nights.</description>

<description>In some places, dark magic seems to permeate the ground itself, corrupting everyone and everything. It can be the consequence of a necromancer ritual, a desecrated sanctuary, or the recent manifestation of otherworldly forces, among others. In such areas, infected animals gather like moths to a flame. Zombies are almost immortal. And above all, scourges like necromancer dragons may claim the place as their wicked nest. From then on, nature itself seems to succumb to the zombie plague, and all hope is lost. Until we show up, that is. As long as we have something to say, there will be no rest for the wicked!</description>

<description>The mystical forest has been home and haven to beasts, spirits, and forgotten gods for thousands of years. While the Forest Guardian slumbers, a nearby human village has grown into a city, a monster of iron and furnaces, hungry for the resources of the forest. Can the forest creatures discover enough potent lore to defend their ancient home from the ravenous city? Or will the city use this lore to power their machines and turn the forest against itself? The battle for HAVEN begins!</description>

Each player's character is sworn by the slayer's oath to seek a glorious death in battle for a crime committed or stain on that dwarf's honor. The slayers eschew worldly pursuits, dye their beards and hair in fierce and fiery reds and oranges, tattoo their ruddy flesh, take up their weapons, and wander the old world seeking their doom battling monsters and enemies of their race.</description>

<description>This bundle includes:The Shipwreck Arcana (base game)The Shipwreck Arcana: Kickstarter 2017 promosThe Shipwreck Arcana: Stars Below ExpansionThe Shipwreck Arcana: the Imago Promo CardTrapped in a drowned world, you and your allies are doomed -- or are you? Using a mystical deck and a healthy dose of logic, you can predict each others' fates and escape unscathed.The Shipwreck Arcana is a compact, co-operative game of deduction, evaluation, and logic. Each player's doom constantly changes as they draw numbered fate tiles from the bag. By choosing which fate to give up and which card to play it on, you can give your allies enough information to identify the fate you're holding...which is important, as the active player cannot communicate with their allies during their turn!Each card has strict rules governing what fates can be played on it. As doom builds up, the cards themselves fade, becoming one-time powers to help the players while new cards cycle in from the deck.Skilled play requires carefully rationing powers, hints, and cycling, while paying attention to not only where each fate was played -- but more importantly, where it wasn't.The rotating active player creates a different group dynamic each turn, preventing any one player from dominating the game. Inexperienced players can still use the group deduction phase to ask questions (while they are not the active player).</description>

<description> It is an era of sudden change and upheaval in Rokugan. Mortal schemes, natural calamities, and celestial turmoil alike have disrupted the political, military, and spiritual equilibrium of the land. Long-simmering rivalries and fresh betrayals ripple through the courts and on the battlefield. The Chrysanthemum Throne is beset by threats from without and within, and the honor of the seven Great Clans shall be put to the test. Who among the clans will prove strong enough to guide Rokugan in these tumultuous times? Will their names be lifted up beside those of the honored ancestors, or will they fall among the ranks of the empire’s most infamous villains? This is the stage of the Legend of the Five Rings Roleplaying Beginner Game, a new roleplaying experience in the world of Rokugan.</description>

He's created bizarre new animals such as the Owligator and Kangarooster! But the heroes can fight back with their own mixed-up weapons, including Sockodiles and the Beaver Cleaver. This version of Munchkin is the craziest ever...but it's still Munchkin, so the first player to Level 10 wins!Moop's Monster Mashup is a standalone game, but can also be combined with Munchkin or any of the Munchkin games.</description>

<description>The monolithic city-state of Dûhr is at once a crucible of emerging and forgotten cultures, a cynosure of commerce, and a titan of military might. Its Great and Lesser Houses rise and fall with the whims of its Family Royal, the Sovereign House Kythidûhr. Amidst the festivals of summer, House Kythidûhr announced its intent to elevate one of Dûhr’s Lesser Houses to Great House status. By autumn’s frosts, the Lesser Houses were deeply embroiled in a fierce battle for the coveted title. Not with soldiers, for that would waste blood and gold, but with the most insidious of political weapons: suspicion and scandal. They attacked each other with aspersions and calumny, well devised and craftily exploited, designed to erode the social standing of their rival Houses and thereby remove them from contention.</description>

<description>The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game is a cooperative adventure game in which the players attempt to complete a scenario, each with three heroes of their choice and a deck of allies, events and attachments to support them. Each round, players send their heroes and allies to quest or to fight with enemies that engage them. However, as the heroes and allies exhaust after questing, defending, or attacking, the players' options are typically insufficient to deal with everything at once. Therefore, players need to determine whether it is more urgent to quest and make progress in the scenario while the enemy forces gain power, or to take down enemies while making no progress, not knowing what will come next.The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game is the base game of a Living Card Game for which new adventure packs are released monthly. The base game contains three scenarios, twelve famous characters from the works of J.R.R. Tolkien (including Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Denethor and Eowyn), and four pre-constructed player decks. Players can either use one of these decks or construct their own deck to increase their chances to be succesful in the more challenging scenarios. The monthly adventure packs contain a new scenario, a new hero, and new player cards to be used in their deck. The base game is for 1-2 players, but with an additional base game the scenarios can be played with up to four players.Although this game is set in Tolkien's Middle Earth, the scenarios do not represent scenes from the books, but rather take place in the seventeen years from Bilbo's birthday until Frodo's departure from the Shire.</description>

<description>Epic Spell Wars of the Battle Wizards: Panic at the Pleasure Palace, the fourth game in the Epic Spell Wars series, takes the trademark humor-filled, mature gameplay and artwork to a new level for 2-6 players. Magically transmitted diseases (MTDs) are a powerful addition to the proceedings, leading wizards to suffer Crotch Krakens, Genital Harpies, and Gorgonorrhea, among other enchanted afflictions. MTDs also give players glyphs that lead to spells that are more epic than ever. In addition, players vie for control of the standee, which protects them from the MTDs that might come their way.</description>

<description> A few magically talented individuals, their devoted followers in tow, have been drawn from their villages across the twisted wilderness to the Ruined City.At the very heart of the city, the cursed Tower of Magic rises into the broiling clouds. From this vantage the Archmage and her Order of Mages ruled these lands for an Age, drawing together the warring magics of the mythic races into one all-powerful and cohesive force. That was, of course, before The Ending.The Ruined City is now home to but a fragment of the mythic races that once served the Archmage and her Order. And until now, no human has dared step foot in these forsaken streets. The newcomers, of human stock, are the descendants of the ancient Mages, now outcasts living in camps in the farthest reaches of the lands. Unusual shows of power in their home villages have already gathered them small but enthusiastic bands of followers. And now they have travelled to meet with representatives of the mythic races, to seek their wisdom and magical secrets.The mythic races are the keepers of six very different spheres of magic, with very different abilities. It was only the power of the Archmage that long ago found ways to combine the spheres and gain higher and higher levels of magic. Now, much of the magic of the mythic races is lost, and the newcomers, having come so far, are told they must now travel the lands to reclaim lost relics sacred to the races. It seems the journey to absolute magical power has only just begun...Archmage is a euro-thematic hybrid, where players take on the role of fledgling Mages, traveling the lands to recover ancient relics, gather followers, and train apprentices in six spheres of magic and beyond. As the power of their Order grows, they will pit apprentices against each other, and attain unheard of spells and magical powers, building their own Mage tower to watch over the lands and weave their magics.When the time of reckoning comes, a new Archmage will rule.Each turn is formed of two phases:The Journey: A Mage travels across the map (formed of hex tiles): discovering new locations; deploying followers to gather relics from Ruins, Libraries, Sacred Glades, and other locations sacred to each of the mythic races; and encountering and dealing with the followers of their opponents.Journey's End: A Mage will finish each Journey in a specific location where they can perform a specific action.Ending a Journey on a Town will let the Mage call on their Followers to deliver the relics and resources they have gathered.Ending in a Settlement (where the spurned descendants of the Mages fled after the Ending) will let a Mage recruit more Followers to their Order.Ending with a Mythic Race will let the Mage train Followers as Apprentices specialising in the magic of that Mythic Race (at a cost of the Relics with which the magic must be weaved).Ending in the Wilderness will let the Mage's followers take more physical control over the area.Ending in the Mage's Tower (once it has been built), will let the Mage train and test their Apprentices. On the floor of the tower (player board) is a mandala in which the Apprentices stand. Moving apprentices on the mandala will change the sorts of spells the Order has access to. Testing apprentices sees one apprentice advance to a higher level and allows an Order to discover new spells and magics beyond what any of the Mythic Races could individually know, and to add to those magics to their spell library.Spells provide Mages with a range of options for strategic and tactical play. Archmage has a modular spell system, with 18 spells included in the base game, and expansions planned to add more sets. Spells are used by expending a cost in Relics, the magical currency of the game that is unique to each mythic race.The game is played over a number of turns, depending on the player count. After the last turn, the Mage with the most powerful Order of Mages, is declared the new Archmage and power is restored to the lands... until the next time!</description>

<description>Every year, Sorcerer City gets built and rebuilt in magically new ways, with blocks moving and rotating in crazy directions. You and your fellow players are rival wizard architects in charge of building the same city district over five years, expanding it and rebuilding it to gain the most money, influence, magic, and victory. Unfortunately, Sorcerer City has a bit of a monster problem, so you must work hard to mitigate the effects of marauding creatures who attack your city district. The wizard architect with the most victory points at the end of five years will be crowned the new head wizard of all of Sorcerer City.</description>

Be smart about it because at the end of each turn, inspectors come and judge one characteristic of your park — and the competition! Good reviews will bring more people to the best parks!

<description>You are not breach mages yet,” Brama lectures as she paces down the line of students, her frail form belying her immense power. “Breach mages have protected us since the beginning — since the burning of the world and our pilgrimage into the dark. It was they who founded Gravehold, our last bastion, and if you wish to stand beside these living legends, you must listen and learn. The Nameless shall come again, as they always have, and you will need to be ready. You are the hope of our future.”</description>

<description>On a battlefield where the fighting is done up close and personal, a reputation for vicious brutality can be just as effective a weapon as any blade or bow. The Bolton cutthroats have simple armor and only a spiked mace at hand, but they are coldly efficient at cutting down enemies with much more elaborate armaments.</description>

<description>When it comes to training soldiers, crossbowmen require a lot less work than average. The real cost comes in the production of the crossbow, itself. Technological advances aren't cheap, and keeping weapons in working order during war is no easy task. Still, a family with resources like the Lannisters can afford to keep this ranged killing machine armed and ready for battle.</description>

<description>Of all the Great Houses of Westeros, there is none more wealthy and ready for war than the Lannisters. Wars are fought with money, and the ability to arm troops with the finest steel and equip them with armor to keep them alive and hacking at the enemy goes a long way over the course of a battle.</description>

<description> Some units can be judged on their military skills or strength, but in war, when another army is advancing, loyalty is a much more valuable asset. The sworn swords are the bedrock of the strategies of the Stark commanders. They are brave and capable to be sure, but their loyalty to the Direwolf banner can never be questioned. To a man, they would rather perish in battle, than leave one of their brothers behind.The A Song of Ice &amp;amp; Fire: Tabletop Miniatures Game – Stark Sworn Swords unit box contains twelve miniature sworn sword figures, one sworn sword unit attachment, a movement tray, and all associated unit cards. These warriors have waited in the frozen north too long, dreaming of battle. They may not be the best equipped units in the war, but they know that shiny armor and pretty swords alone do not make a soldier.—description from the publisher</description>

<description>The great Houses of Westeros had many other, smaller Houses that paid fealty to them. These bonds could be quite strong, reinforced by marriage. When House Stark sent out its ravens to call their Bannermen, House Tully was quick to lend their arms to the cause. In battle, the Sworn Shields would lock their shields together, side-by-side, creating a nearly-impenetrable wall, on which even cavalry charges could be halted.The A Song of Ice &amp;amp; Fire: Tabletop Miniatures Game – Tully Sworn Shields unit box gives House Stark players a bulwark on the battlefield. Sworn Shields can utilize their Shieldwall order to negate hits to their front facing, dulling an enemy charge or subsequent attacks against them. Meanwhile, their trusty longswords will show that this unit isn’t entirely defensive in nature. The set includes twelve miniatures in four different sculpts, along with the unit card and movement tray.—description from the publisher</description>

<description>Combining elements of RPGs, deck-building, and traditional board games, the Mage Knight Board Game puts you in control of one of four powerful Mage Knights as you explore (and conquer) a corner of the Mage Knight universe under the control of the Atlantean Empire. Build your army, fill your deck with powerful spells and actions, explore caves and dungeons, and eventually conquer powerful cities controlled by this once-great faction! In competitive scenarios, opposing players may be powerful allies, but only one will be able to claim the land as their own. In cooperative scenarios, the players win or lose as a group. Solo rules are also included.</description>

<description>In Cthulhu: Rise of the Cults, players impersonate cult leaders who are worshipping the Great Old Ones, while at the same time fighting other cults as unworthy of revealing and tasting the prohibited knowledge. It’s not an easy task when apart from submitting the acts of faith they must simultaneously carry out the perpetual fight against other cults and maintain maximum discretion around curious investigators and other organizations. Their activities focus on the constant quest for spreading influence as well as celebrating dark rituals which are meant to sow the seeds of insanity and uncertainty in people's minds so as to create the power ready for the advent of what is unnamed and lead to the collapse of the present system at the same time.</description>

<description>Players slip into the role of dwarves who have found a cave full of treasure. Now they take turns distributing their finds to the four treasure spaces, but the growing stacks make the dwarves more and more nervous. Should they secure their share now and make a run for it? Some dwarves are greedy and hang back, and by doing so they might miss the right moment to leave, with another player stealing their favorite treasure from right under their nose. And if the worse comes to the worst, the cave orc will catch them!</description>

<description>Description from the publisher:Arcadia Quest: Riders is a new modular expansion for Arcadia Quest and Arcadia Quest: Inferno, and requires either core set to play.Each Guild will get a mount. Mounts allow a Hero to saddle up and ride into battle in style. Mounts all have a shove-style ability, being able to clear other characters out of the way. They will also all have a unique ability, giving each Mount something cool they can do. And, like the Pets, they will have specialized gear that they can use to enhance their abilities and increase their survivability on the battlefield.Along with the mounts, the expansion will also have two brand-new heroes, as well as a brand-new major villain and a brand-new minor villain. The set also comes with a new 6-mission campaign. There are alternate scenarios for use with other Arcadia Quest expansions as well: if you have the Pets expansion, there’s an alternate version of one of the scenarios that makes specific use of that material. Same goes for Beyond the Grave. And if you have both, there’s yet another alternate scenario you can try out.Be on the lookout for more information as the set gets closer to release.</description>

Evil Rhujas roaming the land want to capture the gemstones of the Inox. That's why the Inox have selected the hardest to reach and most dangerous place to hide their gemstones: the rock wall behind the Iquazú waterfall. Their water dragon Silon blocks the waterfall so that the brave Inox can rappel down the rock wall behind it to place their gemstones there, out of harm's way. The gushing water and the dangerous water snakes at the bottom will stop the Rhujas from getting the gemstones. Which player in Iquazú will manage to use their cards skillfully and place their colored gemstones in the best spots?</description>

<description>Temporal Odyssey is a drafting battle card game about dueling time travelers for 2 and 4 players. Draft from the past, present, or future, and enlist legendary heroes and creatures to fight by your side. Group your characters to get them to share their abilities, using this both offensively and defensively. Regroup often to adapt to the situation. Rewind time to prevent your own death but be careful — each time you must suffer judgement from Lovox the god of time. Destroy your opponent's stability and deliver the final blow to banish them from the timeline and win the game!</description>

<description> Description from the publisher:A Song of Ice &amp;amp; Fire: Tabletop Miniatures Game lets players take control of their favorite Houses from the novels — represented by trays of high-quality, pre-assembled miniatures — and lead them into battle against their opponents. Players can recreate their favorite moments from the series or create their own stories. What if the Red Wedding never happened, and Robb Stark assaulted King's Landing? Now fans can find out!Battles can range from large-scale wars with hundreds of miniatures to simple skirmishes between a few units without complicating the elegantly designed rules. The game features several unique systems, including alternating activations that keep the players engaged; a Rank System that changes a unit's capabilities as the battle rages on; a Tactics System that provides strategic powers fueled by a finite resource each round; and, most importantly, the iconic Heroes, such as Robb Stark and Jaime Lannister, that can change the course of war both on and off the battlefield.</description>

<description>In Dungeon Hustle, 2-4 players are archetypal fantasy characters running through a dungeon picking up swords, keys, shields, scrolls and potions. Each item comes in different colors, and to pick them up, you must hustle through a path of dungeon tiles of matching color; once you step on a new color (or a corner space), you pick up the tiles that you had stepped on. If, for example, you start on a red key and move on a path that consists of a red sword, another red key, a red shield, and finally a white sword, you stop on the white sword, then pick up all of the red items, including the one where you started movement. You use these items to fight monsters, fulfill quests, and purchase other items.</description>

Regardless, the King is dead without any known heirs, so it's up to the five factions of the realm to decide who will be the new king: Will it be you or your opponent?

<description>Ambyria is Paw-Warrior's debut game. A fantasy card game, Ambyria is a non-collectible strategy card game with a dash of luck and a pinch of chaos. Ember perfectly caters to the little voice in all of us that holds a grudge. With plenty of opportunities for revenge, you won’t have to listen to that voice for very long before it’s satisfied. Don’t be shy and show no mercy, as you will receive none in return!</description>

Players also compete for the most items valued at 3, 4, and 5.

It was there, unaware, helpless in front of his attack: a quickly and decisively move and it’s neck would not have even realized to be drilled. No worries, no tension, the cold calm that always filled him, made him perfect for this task.

<description>A world of peace has been torn asunder by the opening of a vile portal from the goblin kingdom. Nasty goblins pour into the peaceful groves and villages of the elf world, setting the realm ablaze. Now you, the heroes, must quest in order to right this wrong. There are two paths to victory: closing the portal or slaying all the goblins. Which one will you choose? Either way, your guests will be aided by the help of the surviving mushroom folk — and by the epic items that have been lost in the realm's deep dungeons. The world is ending quickly, so you must act fast to save it, but you also need to know when your luck will run out...</description>

<description>5-Minute Dungeon is a chaotic, co-operative, real-time card game in which players have only five minutes to escape the randomized dungeon. Communication and teamwork are critical to survival because there's no time to form a carefully considered plan — and no predicting what dangers lie ahead.</description>

<description>In Throne of the World, each player represents one of the thirteen races struggling for that throne. Players play different kinds of profession cards that can either produce income or force other players to take their cards back into their hands. In each turn, players choose a playing mode that determines how many cards they draw and how many action points they get. Action points are used to play cards, either profession cards, action cards (which activate the profession cards), or special skill cards. The different races can also use their special abilities to tip the balance in their favor.</description>

<description>Bemused is a card game for 4-6 players in which the players take on the role of a muse seeking to elevate their chosen human virtuoso to the greatest height of celebrity and influence. To do so, the muse must eliminate their virtuoso's rivals by levying doubts and dreads upon them until they are driven insane...or worse. Bemused is not a social deduction game. Although there are deductive elements, the game is a social interaction experience that encourages shameless table talk, bluffing, and deal-making as players seek to maximize their end game scores.</description>

<description>Cytosis: A Cell Building Game is a worker placement game that takes place inside a human cell. Players start out with a number of workers and on a player’s turn, they will place one of their workers in any available location within that cell. Some of the locations provide players with resources (e.g., mRNA, ATP); some with actions (e.g., convert resources, collect cards). Resources are used to build enzymes, hormones and/or receptors, which score Health Points. The player with the most Health Points at the end of the game wins!</description>

<description>In the distant past the Vikings came upon a great, hidden and uninhabited island, its verdant lands rich in resources. The Vikings hid the island’s location from the rest of the known world, killing all those who stumbled upon it. Soon after, many great clans established settlements across the island. Then the true master of the island revealed himself: Deep below the earth’s surface lay Ymir, the powerful Jotunn of old, slumbering since time began. Sensing the Vikings’ trespass, the giant awoke enraged and emerged a juggernaut of destruction as he rampaged across the island.</description>

As the great powers of Europe stretch their colonial empires further and further, they will inevitably lay claim to a place where spirits still hold power - and when they do, the land itself will fight back alongside the islanders who live there.</description>

<description>Kharnage is a fast, fun and fighting game in a med-fan world in which you are the warchief of the mighty humans, the strong (and alcoholic) dwarves, the amazing horde of goblins, or the ferocious orcs (and their giant!). Your goal in Kharnage is to take control of the strategically essential, astoundingly beautiful, envy of all other nations: a hill. Yes, just a hill. Admittedly it is a nice hill. It may have a very commanding view of the surroundings, or it may not. You won't know until you get up there! To do so, you're going to have to drive off the armies of the other players by simply causing as mayhem and bloodshed as possible.</description>

<description>In Prospectus, players are mages trying to earn the most money by trading potions in the Kriztus potion exchange. As mages, players can of course see into the market futures to gain an edge in their trading. However, your skills at this are somewhat limited, as things will not always go according to your predictions. The game makes use of a unique and eye-catching crystal ball mechanism (inspired by the cube tower in Wallenstein, Shogun, and Amerigo) ensuring no market prediction is a sure bet!</description>

<description>Haven Town is facing total annihilation at the hands (and teeth) of a horde of monsters from beyond the Shadowrift.You, the heroes, must band together to drive them back. To do this, you will need powerful spells, skills, attacks and loot. When the game begins, you are a basic hero; you can explore and fight. Luckily for you, Shadowrift is a deck-building game! You can buy new cards to add to your deck, cards that will define you as an adventurer and complement the strengths of your fellow heroes. Unlike other deck-builders, there is constant interaction with your fellow players as you figure out who will gain which benefit from the limited supply of townsfolk, offer their coin to help construct walls, and seek healing from anyone who's learned such magic.Shadowrift also features monsters that don't merely sit waiting to be slain; if you leave them alone, they will rip Haven Town asunder. They'll kill people, break walls, and kick your heroes in the face. Combat with them is intuitive (though frequently painful). For defeating a monster, heroes gain Heroism, a simple, consistent boost to their power that makes them better at anything they undertake. Since the monsters won't stop coming until the last Shadowrift is sealed or the town has been built into a mighty fortress, you'll need every boost you can take.The second edition of Shadowrift features many improved mechanisms, including a revised system for how monsters choose who to attack (based on types of villagers, instead of specific people) and a new system for monster powers (making them much more dangerous). It also has a revised card layout and a great deal of new and improved artwork.</description>

<description>One Deck Dungeon is a card game "roguelike" — a dungeon delve that is different every time, difficult to survive, with a character you build up from scratch. The deck consists of various monsters, traps, and other encounters from the dungeon. Each card, though, depicts both the obstacle to overcome and the potential rewards for doing so. When you defeat a card, you claim it as either treasure, an item, or a skill, tucking it under the appropriate side of your character card to show its benefits.</description>

<description>On entering the wizard's academy, the new apprentices swore a solemn vow to learn the ways of magic, protect the institution, and uphold its values. Unfortunately most of them have failed to learn any significant magic in their first year. Susie coasts by on her natural talents, Malkar would sooner sell his soul for power than read a book, Nyvetta has forgone that option along with opposable thumbs upon accidentally turning herself into a bear, Flitter is only here to steal magic items to sell on the black market, and Bramblethrone spends too long talking to trees to get anything done. As a group of students, they could not be worse.</description>

<description>Telin's cruel blade has long been writing the history of Shaqua Maertis, the Empire of Elements. The peaceful people of the land came to terms with Telin's rule and dared not give voice to their sinister thoughts and unabated fears. And so long as they did not speak of those thoughts and fears in public, Telin's iron hand was kept at bay, his reach away from their homes and children. Years went by , and decades followed — until there came a day when Helloder, a creature made of darkness, with plans darker still, discovered magic, a long-forgotten magic that offered him the opportunity to claim power for himself.</description>

<description>Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island is a game created by Ignacy Trzewiczek, the author of Stronghold. This time Trzewiczek takes the players to a deserted island, where they'll play the parts of shipwreck survivors confronted by an extraordinary adventure. They'll be faced with the challenges of building a shelter, finding food, fighting wild beasts, and protecting themselves from weather changes. Building walls around their homes, animal domestication, constructing weapons and tools from what they find and much more awaits them on the island. The players decide in which direction the game will unfold and – after several in-game weeks of hard work – how their settlement will look. Will they manage to discover the secret of the island in the meantime? Will they find a pirate treasure, or an abandoned village? Will they discover an underground city or a cursed temple at the bottom of a volcano? Answers to these questions lie in hundreds of event cards and hundreds of object and structure cards that can be used during the game...</description>

<description>OVERVIEW:The Gnumies &amp;amp; their friends from the planet Gnum love big Parties! They like to see Borsis, Dancemites, Boggelors or Divalettis as guests at their parties. But no one wants the dreaded Wullawakis at his party. The Gnummies &amp;amp; their friends are shown on the Gnumies card, &amp;amp; the guests on the party cards. There are 4 of each party card valued from 1 to 10, &amp;amp; one of each party card valued from 11 to 15. The players try to win the most party cards, worth the most points, by playing their Gnumie cards. If a player has 2 or more party cards of the same value, their value multiplies, (2 of kind gets you 20 points, 3 of a kind 50 points and 4 of a kind 100 points). These of course can only be done with the cards that are valued from 1 to 10. A player who wins a Wullawaki, loses points. Having 1 Wullawaki will force you to lose the lowest valued party card that you have. Having 2 Wullawakis will force you to lose the highest valued party card in his party room. With 3 or more Wullawakis, the player will discard as many party cards as he has Wullawakis, (players choice in this case). Of course, the player with the most points at the end of the game is the WINNER!!!GAME PLAY:1) Any player turns over the top-most card in the party supply stack.2) Now each player selects a Gnumie card from his hand (Cards have a value from 10 to 100), and places it face-down in front of him (in his Party Room!). When all players have placed their bids face-down on the table, all players then reveal their bids.3) The player who played the highest valued bid in his party room wins the face-up party card.4) If 2 or more players tie with the highest bid, the player who has the the most Luckynits (small figures at the bottom of each Gnumie card), wins the party card.5) The player who wins the party card must discard the Gnumie card that he won with that bid.6) The other players take back their losing bid party cards. The round is now over and we repeat with Step 1 again.7) There is a little twist in the bidding when the Wullawaki card (bad card) comes out. The player with the highest Gnumie card still wins the Wullawaki card, but gets to take back his Gnumie card into his hand and the other players lose their Gnumie cards!8) The is also a "WILD CARD" in this game. It is called the "COPICASTOR". It is a card used to make at least a pair of party cards. The Copicastor takes on the form of the lowest valued party card that the player has in his party room. This insures that a player will have at least a pair of cards and also make the low valued cards somewhat valuable to have, since some people may avoid making a high bid on a low value card. But, if you get this Copicastor it makes that low valued card at least worth 20 points (for a pair).9) The game ends when 1 player is left with his Gnumie cards. Since, he can't bid against anybody else, he takes the top most party cards as he has Gnumie cards in his hand.10) Scoring is based on attaining pairs, three-of-a-kind &amp;amp; 4-of-a-kind of the numbered party cards that the players bid on (check the Overview paragraph above). If no pairs are attained, the value of that card is scored. So, if you have two 5-point cards, you score 20 Points for having a pair. But, if you have only one 5-point card you score 5 points!10) The player with the most points at the end of the game wins!!!Ages 8 and upRe-implements:Asterix: Das Kartenspiel</description>

<description> Tyrants of the Underdarkis a territory control game with a deck-building element.Each player leads a house of Drow in a section of the Underdark below the Sword Coast. The Drow house is represented by a deck of cards, with each card being a minion in that player's deck. Each minion belongs to one of five aspects of Drow society, and those aspects correspond to different strategies in the game, e.g., malice minions excel at assassinating opponents' troops, while ambition minions are best at recruiting additional minions and promoting minions to your "inner circle", which is a special zone that increases their value at the end of the game.When you set up the game, you create an 80-card deck by shuffling two 40-card half-decks together, with the half-decks being Drow, Dragons, Demons, and Elemental Evil.A central marketplace has new minions that can be recruited through influence, one of two resources in the game; purchased cards are placed in your discard pile, then shuffled together with other cards in your deck when needed. The other resource is power, which allows you to place troops on the game board, expand your forces across the map of the Underdark, manipulate happenings in the city, and assassinate enemy troops.Players gain points by controlling sites, recruiting valuable minions, promoting minions to your inner circle, and assassinating troops, and whoever ends the game with the most points wins.</description>

<description>Seven daring adventurers have trespassed in a dragon's lair, initially seeking its treasure but now just trying to make it out alive as the dragon has woken and is chasing them through its labyrinth. The sooner that a dragon captures an adventurer, the fewer points it's worth at the end of the round — and should an adventurer actually manage to escape, many points in treasure await.</description>

<description> Puzzle Strike: Bag of Chips is all that and a bag of chips!Puzzle Strike is a card game played with cardboard chips instead of cards that simulates a puzzle video game called puzzle fighter that, in-turn, simulates the fighting game street fighter that is emulated in puzzle fighterIf you don’t understand any of that, that’s ok! Puzzle Strike is a complete game in a box that has the fun of a customizable card game without the marketing scheme of selling you parts of the game in random packs. You build your deck *as* you play the game. Every game is different because the bank starts with a different set of chips each game. Also, there are 10 characters to choose from, each with different gameplay. Between all that, there are over 411 MILLION starting conditions in a 4-player game.A built-in comeback mechanic means that when you're on the edge of losing, you're also able to do even more combos than usual.Shuffling cards takes too long and is boring, so in Puzzle Strike you just put your cardboard tokens in a bag and shake them up to shuffle! Plus, it’s pretty ballin’ to play a game with chips. Play it on your yacht, impress potential mates, etc.Though the game is fun even if you're terrible at it, it's also balanced for high level play by veteran asymmetric game balancer David Sirlin (Street Fighter HD Remix, Puzzle Fighter HD Remix, Kongai, Yomi, and Flash Duel.)Puzzle Strike contains:Almost 350 cardboard chips4 cloth bags8-page full color rulebookColorful box with inside designed to separate the chips by type, for storage </description>

<description> Bloodborne: The Card Game is based on the Chalice Dungeons in the video game Bloodborne — the ever-changing labyrinths and tombs carved out by the Great Ones beneath the fallen city of Yharnam, where horrifying creatures reside. Players compete to kill monsters and take their blood.In general, Bloodborne is a game about risk management with a bit of group think, inventory management/upgrades, and tactical play. You start with a hand of basic weapons, which you get to upgrade to improve your fighting combos and capabilities.Each turn, one monster chosen at random attacks players, who fight back as a team, with everyone playing a card from their hand simultaneously to attempt to kill the monster. Players collect blood from the monster, assuming it dies, based on how much damage they dealt. Monsters can fight back with exploding dice that can potentially deal infinite damage.Players can fight as long as they want, but if they die in combat, they lose their progress. Players can opt out of fighting to bank their blood and save it permanently. Collected blood counts as victory points.Says designer Eric M. Lang, "My goal with Bloodborne was to channel the intensity and frustration of the video game into a contest between players. Lots of death."</description>

<description>Alchimia — a land where the works of a single grand alchemist has caused alchemy to develop more quickly than other technology. The everyday lives of the people rely on the alchemy factories that this first pioneer built.InArs Alchimia, you work at one of these factories. As an overseer belonging to the Academy, you take orders from the people, gather resources, and transmute them — but you need to be more efficient than your competition.The game lasts four rounds, with each round representing a year. Each round, players take turns placing one or more of their workers on one action they want to do: gather resources, take up an order, employ an assistant, or transmute at the alchemy forges. The trick is that the more workers on one spot, the less effective an action becomes; if you want to place workers on a spot where there are already some, you'll have to exceed the number of workers already there.</description>

<description>In a mythic oriental universe, great powers battle for control of Three Realms: The Heavens, The Earth and The Hells.Sangoku(meaning "three realms") is an elegant and thematic card game by renowned designer Mike Elliott.In the game, players recruit warriors – Dogs, Samurais, Oni and Dragons – to their armies by playing poker hands to each of the Three Realms. The best hand in each realm wins, and a Warrior is summoned from the winning cards – but the weakest cards also summon the most powerful Warriors, with the 2 card in each suit (Fire, Metal, Earth, Water, Wood) summoning a mighty Dragon. With these recruited Warrior tokens, players advance on their opponents to gain ascendancy in the Realms. They can also wager and collect Legend cards, which when combined into sets can be used to powerful effect, including bringing forth uniquely damaging Warriors.</description>

<description>Following the success of their critically acclaimed family card game, Infernal Contraption, Privateer Press is pleased to announce Scrappers, a family board game for 2-4 players ages 9 and up. In Scrappers players take on the role of lively goblin mechanics as they race around a factory trying to pull parts off a constantly moving conveyor belt in order to be the first to complete their contraptions. Featuring stunning full-color artwork from Privateer Press Artist Chris Walton, Scrappers is scheduled to release world-wide in September 2009.“The game features fast, intuitive game play that takes only minutes to learn, but presents a strategic depth that will challenge both new young players and seasoned veterans alike,” said Privateer Press Chief Creative Officer Matt Wilson when asked about the new Bodgers game, “Add to that the maniacal and zany cast of the Bodgers goblin mechanics and Scrappers is a game everyone will want to play again and again.”</description>

<age>No Thank You, Evil!:Story, Please!No Thank You, Evil!: Uh-Oh, Monsters!No Thank You, Evil!: I'm a GuideNo Thank You, Evil!: It's Raining Cats and Dinosaurs</age>
<description>A game of No Thank You, Evil! involves a Guide and two to four other players. It’s a group game of make-believe, played in the joint imagination of the players and Guide. The Guide sets the scene, the players create characters and decide what they want their characters to do, and together they determine what happens next.The Guide’s job is to understand the game, help the players create their characters and follow the rules, and be the storyteller who shapes the gameplay. A Guide may also be the “voice” of creatures and characters in the game. The Guide is usually a grownup, but an older child with a little experience with the game can take on this role as well.Each player creates a character and then acts as that character. He uses the character’s special skills and equipment, and decides what actions his character will take. Maybe he wants to fight the dragon, win over the mayor, or beat the rabbit in a race.The Guide starts the story, using an adventure from the game or one she made up. The players take actions as their characters.Whenever a character wants to take an action, the Guide decides how hard the action is (on a scale of 0 to 8). This is called the Goal.If an action is something that a regular person can do most of the time, like talk to a friend, take a walk, or have some lunch, then the Goal is 0, and you don’t need to roll the die. You just do the thing you want to do.If the action is harder, like fighting a creature, climbing a wall, or charming an evil sorceress, then the Goal is somewhere between 1 and 8. In that case, you make a roll to see if your action succeeds or fails.This basic game mechanism is simple: Roll a die and see if your result equals or beats the Goal. You can make the Goal a bit easier if you Try Harder by spending a point from one of your Pools—but you only have so many points, so use them wisely!“I want to hit the yawp with my frog slingshot!”“To hit the yawp, you have to roll a 4 or higher. If you want to Try Harder, it will cost you 1 point from your Tough pool.”“I want to Try Harder to hit the yawp, so I’m going to use 1 Tough.”“OK, now you’ll only have to roll a 3 or higher. You rolled a 5! You hit the yawp right in the shoulder with your frog slingshot! The yawp bellows and staggers back.”You can use your character’s special abilities, companions, and gear to help succeed at your actions, or to find different and creative ways to solve problems.Depending on whether you succeed or fail, the Guide describes what happens as a result, relying on her imagination and creativity, and the adventure continues forward! It ends when the players reach the adventure’s goal and overcome the obstacles they’ve encountered along the way.http://www.nothankyouevil.com/</description>

<description>A dangerous, perplexing word game and dungeon delve where only those with the quickest wit and largest vocabulary survive. As sorcerers of the mystical art of Word Weaving, you and several other treasure hunters will descend into the Tomb of the Forgotten Consonant and quest for the Syllabus of the Lost Syllable. When the journey is complete, only the most heroic word smith will walk away with the win.Dungeon Scrollis a word game where players spell words (cast spells) to meet specific word challenges (dungeon encounters)to score points (gain gold).A layered dungeon of 9 cards is formed by randomly selecting cards from the Entrance (x1), 1st Floor (x3), 2nd Floor(x3), Dungeon Boss(x1) and Final Room (x1) dungeon cards and combining them into a face down stack. Each turn the top card will be flipped (starting with the Entrance) and players will face the specific encounter on the card. Thematically it could be anything from a Skeleton or Pit Trap to a Travelling Merchant.Players each have a hand of letter cards from which they will spell words with different points values (letters are worth varying points and some cards provide multiplication bonuses). If the encounter is a "combat" encounter, typically the player that can play the highest point word will win the encounter and claim the highest gold reward on the dungeon card, with other players claiming the second and third reward - however that is not always true as each dungeon challenge provides twists and turns; to the sorts of words that can be played. Other "Special" encounters might allow such actions as players to sell their letter cards for gold.The player with the most gold at the end of the game wins.</description>

<description>InThunder &amp;amp; Lightning, players take on the role of Thor or Loki and fight their way through an army in an epic mythological showdown. Because Loki has already stolen Odin's Crown, the Allfather has entrusted his son Thor with his prized ring of power, Draupnir, to help him defeat the vile trickster. But who really has what it takes to gain control over both relics and therefore claim the throne of Asgard?Thunder &amp;amp; Lightning, a reimplementation ofHera and Zeus, features the same gameplay as the earlier design, but with larger decks of cards with a different distribution of powers.In the game, each player starts with nine cards in hand, then places three cards face down in their first row, with these rows butting against one another and each player having space for four rows in their playing area. If a player loses a card in a row, then any cards in the same column behind this card slide forward to fill the empty slot. On a turn, a player has as many action points as the number of columns they have in the playing area. They can use these action points to draw cards, play cards to the battlefield, play a mythological card for its power, or challenge an opponent's card.To challenge, the player chooses a card in their first row that abuts an opponent's card, then reveals both of them. Most cards have a strength value (0-7), and the card with the lower strength value is discarded, with the opponent's other cards in the same column then sliding forward.If a player cannot use all of their actions or has no actions (due to having no cards on the battlefield) or loses control of Odin's Crown/Ring, then they lose the game.</description>

<description>Greedy Greedy Goblinsis a simultaneous play, strategic tile placement and bluffing game.Players lead a clan of goblin miners who want to gather the most valuable collection of gems. Coins are scored for gem tiles on the mines you have claimed, with bonuses for dynamite tiles — but if there is too much dynamite, the mine (and all the riches within) are destroyed!In more detail, players sit around a circle composed of cave game boards and the guildhall game board, with sixty mining tiles placed face-down within this circle. Each round, while playing at the same time, players use one hand to look at one mining tile at a time, then place it on one of the cave game boards. At any time, a player can claim the guildhall or a cave by placing one of their three goblins on the board, after which no more tiles or goblins may be placed on this board.Once everyone has placed all of their goblins (or decided not to place them), players resolve the boards. The goblin on the guildhall draws a minion card that provides a special ability, while each goblin in a cave scores coins based on the gems, diamonds, dynamite and monsters found there; these goblins can also take minion cards if minion tiles have been placed in the cave. Dynamite multiplies the value of a cave, but three or more sticks blows the place up, costing you coins.If someone has one hundred or more coins, the game ends and whoever has the most coins wins; if not, set up another round and go digging again.</description>

<description>Myths at War, first published asGuerra de Mitos, is a card game set in a fantastic world where different mythologies coexist. It is a different, dynamic game designed to be able to build different decks with very distinct and varied strategies, and each expansion increases both the number of available mythologies and the game possibilities.This first installment ofMyths at Warcontains 300 cards split between the Nordic, Egyptian and Japanese mythologies (GDMI+GDM3 spanish editions). Each mythology includes two pantheons (cards that define your game strategy) + cards for the gods deck (which includes characters, events and resources) + cards for the designs deck (actions, equipment and summonings).Each player inMyths at Warneeds to build his own deck of at least 51 cards (1 pantheon / 20 gods / 30 designs) of his choice, and each expansion increases the diversity of characters, actions and strategies you can use in order to achieve victory but all expansions can be played on his own.During the game, each player has to bring into play the cards his oracles offer him and play actions from the designs deck both in the influence phase (where the gods plan from their pantheon) and in the confrontation phase (where the characters who decide to go to battle fight to decrease the opponent’s power) to obtain supremacy or consign the opponent to oblivion.</description>

<description>Epic PVP: Fantasyis a head-to-head battling card game. At the start of the game, each player chooses a class deck and a race deck, then shuffles them together to create unique character combinations, such as a Human Paladin or Goblin Druid. Each combination creates unique tactics and strategies to use when you battle.The goal of the game is to defeat your opponent by reducing them to zero life. Players do this by playing moves that act as both attacks and blocks as well as with special cards and abilities granted by the player's choice of class and race.During a turn, a player adds cards to their "aggression pile", then chooses how many cards to draw from their aggression pile into their hand. The player uses the aggression provided by the cards that remain in their aggression pile to play move cards to block incoming enemy attacks. If an attack isn't blocked, the player takes damage, specifically one damage per unblocked enemy attack. Then all the moves played by that player become attacks for the opponent to deal with on the opponent's next turn. There's more to it than that, but those are the basics...</description>

Each player has two actions each turn and can use these actions to either look at the top tiles in one pile; dig one tile (possibly earning points or money); employ new workers; or get speciality cards. Tiles can be anything from dirt to hard stone, monsters or treasures. The game ends when both hot spring tiles are found. If the same player found both, he wins automatically; if not, the player with the most points earned from various tiles wins.Takara Islandfeatures the same gameplay asThe Edict of King Budeaunia, but with a different setting and modified artwork.</description>

<description>Once upon a time, the royal wedding of Duke Kune and Princess Lakia brought joy and celebration to every warren in the Bunny Dutchy.Alas, for all the carrot cake that was consumed at the wedding was in vain. One day, a petty argument boiled over to a fight, and once the fight grew to the point that the royal guards had to be called in, there was no way to contain the situation. It was going to be Kune v Lakia!KUNE v LAKIA: A Chronicle Of A Royal Lapine Divorce Foretoldis a game for two players, each acting for the Duke or the Princess during the divorce proceedings.A starting hand of five assets (manors, jewelry and abundant wealth) is drawn, and the players use those assets to influence members of the royal lapine court (the abbot, the sorceress, the duke's sister, the king, and the knight). The favors gained and plots hatched are represented by cards added to each player's deck. These cards can be used to further influence courtiers, hide property, and hinder the opponent's ability to do the same.Much like in a real-life divorce, this is a highly interactive process, and not an easy one at that. In a game of behind-the-scenes plotting and intrigue, only the most clever player will emerge victorious in the struggle for prestige, property and power!</description>

<description>Castle Assaultis a unique gaming experience combining the ferocious onslaught of Tower Defense games with the strategic elements of CCGs and progressive advancement of RPG's. Castle Assault seeks to break the mold of traditional card games and organically extracts the most enjoyable parts of these different genres and distill them into a standalone concept. Castle Assault plays in about 30 mins, and is for 1 or 2 Players.Each Player controls a Castle on either side of the Battlefield with 10 Health and a Hero outside of the Battlefield. Players play Units from their hand to the gameboard and these Units physically move toward the opposing Castle based on the Abilities of that Unit and your choices with the intent to bring your opponent from 10 to 0 Health. Should you destroy your opponents Castle or destroy their Hero you win!"More details please" - a Battle Card Game with tons of combat and strategy. Card combat is fast and furious; every time two opposing Units touch each other in the same column, they Engage in combat (which is often), and can happen either during the Move Units step or during the Open Phase by Charging or using an Ability described on your Units. Combat is resolved immediately with Unit cards exchanging their combat values at the same time (with no luck involved). Should either Unit have a higher attack number then the Armor + Health of the opposing Unit, that Unit is destroyed. Should a Unit smash the opposing Castle without a defending unit, that Unit attacks the opposing Castle directly lowering that Castles Health by the Unit's attack value.Every deck is also customizable meaning your Unit selection can be optimized before battle, but note this is not a 'pay-to-play' type game. You receive all the cards from all warbands including the 1-Player warband in the Core Edition (NO BOOSTERS).Most Units have Abilities to; keep them alive, move more quickly, laterally move, resurrect, summon allies, surprise, dissipate, and damage the opposing Castle from afar. You may feign attacks, play Commands to make your Heroes more powerful in a myriad of methods to tactically breakdown your opponent.The 1-Player Campaign provides a "Right-Outta-the-Box Experience" with 9 Scenarios culminating in a final boss showdown. 1-Player mode operates by Monsters auto-populating in the opposing Castle with your victory condition changing every Scenario including outright smashing the opposing Castle, destroying a boss overlord, or surviving the onslaught. With 9 Scenarios per 6 warbands it creates 54 different challenges (9 campaigns x 6 warbands = 54 games).</description>

<description>So far your first year at the Elementary College has been slightly disappointing. They taught you to light a flickering flame at the tip of your finger, but other than that you've spent much more time reading books than learning powerful spells as future great wizards like you should.So when you heard about the Big Book of Madness hidden in the great school library, you couldn't help but to sneak in and peek in this intriguing tome in spite of your professors' warnings. When you slowly lift the cover of the terrible book, dozens of dreadful creatures rush out, threatening to destroy the world itself! This was your mistake, and only you can fix it now! Learn from the library to fight back against the monsters, and try not to sink into insanity...The Big Book of Madnessis a challenging co-operative game in which the players are magic students who must act as a team to turn all the pages of the book, then shut it by defeating the terrible monsters they've just freed.Each player has their own element deck that they build during the game and use for several purposes, such as learning or casting a spell, adding a new element to their deck, destroy or healing a curse. Spells allow you to support your playmates, improve your deck, draw cards, etc. — but the monsters from the book fight back. Each comes with terrible curses that are triggered every turn unless you dispel them in time. They will make you discard elements, add madness cards to your deck, or lose spells...If you manage to turn six pages and defeat all of the monsters, you win the game!</description>

<description> Tyrants of the Underdarkis a territory control game with a deck-building element.Each player leads a house of Drow in a section of the Underdark below the Sword Coast. The Drow house is represented by a deck of cards, with each card being a minion in that player's deck. Each minion belongs to one of five aspects of Drow society, and those aspects correspond to different strategies in the game, e.g., malice minions excel at assassinating opponents' troops, while ambition minions are best at recruiting additional minions and promoting minions to your "inner circle", which is a special zone that increases their value at the end of the game.When you set up the game, you create an 80-card deck by shuffling two 40-card half-decks together, with the half-decks being Drow, Dragons, Demons, and Elemental Evil.A central marketplace has new minions that can be recruited through influence, one of two resources in the game; purchased cards are placed in your discard pile, then shuffled together with other cards in your deck when needed. The other resource is power, which allows you to place troops on the game board, expand your forces across the map of the Underdark, manipulate happenings in the city, and assassinate enemy troops.Players gain points by controlling sites, recruiting valuable minions, promoting minions to your inner circle, and assassinating troops, and whoever ends the game with the most points wins.</description>

Players can also unleash their special abilities, that may allow them to play more cards or activate special effects.There are two types of cards, and players draw them according to their position on the racing track, keeping the game always balanced and uncertain until the end.There is also a "championship mode" that allows players to customize their cars and play multiple races.The board is modular and is made by twelve cardboard terrains, all with unique effects and obstacles, including various 3D elements like bridges, volcanoes and wild creatures.</description>

<description>Awesome Kingdom: The Tower of Hateskullis a lightweight, fast and funny dungeon-crawling card game in which players compete to be the most awesome hero after three days of adventuring.Players enter the dungeon as one of eight epic characters, such as the Ragebarian, Prestidigimancer, or Paladude, with each character being bestowed with an appropriately amazing ability. The dungeon is formed out of a circle of dungeon wall tiles, with dungeon cards filling most of those spaces and heroes filling the rest.A day lasts three turns, and on a turn, you play an action card from your hand, normally moving your hero around the circle of cards (skipping over other heroes) and claiming the card on which you land, which could be treasure, a monster (which wounds you before you defeat it), a trap, or even a magic item. Cards are worth various amounts of awesomeness, and you want to be the most awesome hero at the end of the third day.</description>

Choose strategies that will bring prosperity to the land and glory to your court. Defend the realm from threats and famine. Only the player with the most majestic court will be named heir.There are many paths to choose from, but only one will become the next monarch. Who will reign?Monarchis a light strategy game for 3-4 players that lasts 45 minutes. The primary mechanic is set collection; each of the sisters aims to assemble a court of Court Cards in order to prove her worth: wise advisors, exotic animals, and symbolic regalia. Each of these Court Cards provides crowns, and the sister whose court contains the most crowns at the end of the game becomes the Queen.There are tricks to assembling a majestic court. Some cards don't work together well: the Astronomer is worth nothing if in a court with the Fireworks because he will be unable to see anything! Other cards work very well together: the Beastkeeper is worth more crowns for each animal she shares a court with.</description>

<description> "A great host came out of Angmar in 1409, and crossing the river entered Cardolan and surrounded Weathertop. The Dúnedain were defeated and Arveleg was slain. The Tower of Amon Sûl was burned and razed; but the palantír was saved and carried back in retreat to Fornost, Rhudaur was occupied by evil Men subject to Angmar, and the Dúnedain that remained there were slain or fled west."–J.R.R. Tolkien, "Eriador, Arnor, and the Heirs of Isildur"Accompanied by the young Dúnedain Ranger Amarthíul, a handful of Middle-earth's greatest heroes make their way out of the deadly troll-fells and into the crumbling ruins of Rhudaur. Their path leads them past piece after piece of evidence of the region's historic collapse; they cross through tattered cities and make their way around towers of stone and rubble, long forgotten and ravaged by years of disrepair.At length, even as they can still sense the evils that have pursued them since the dungeons of Mount Gram, the heroes come across the remnants of a keep marked by the same symbol that appears on the pendant that Amarthíul inherited from the captured Ranger, Iárion. They are not safe here, and time is pressing. Still, the heroes realize this ruined keep might hold some clue to the threat currently growing in the North. Despite the dangers, they decide to brave its foreboding stairwells and darkened halls in search of whatever secrets it may yield… </description>

All elf girls and elf boys receive a map of Elfenland, and they have to visit as many famous towns in Elfenland as possible, using the common types of transportation: dragons, unicorns, giant pigs, elfcycles, troll wagons, magic clouds, ferries and rafts. These types of transportation, however, are available in limited numbers and can be used only in specific regions. Thus, an exciting race starts among the elves to find out who will make the best use of the available transportation. The one who visits the most towns wins.Elfengold, an expansion forElfenland, adds gold coins to the game that players use to bid for the Travel Counters and other new items. It also adds Gold Value Tokens to the towns that indicate how much gold players earn for visiting a town. Two magic spells and a new obstacle — a Sea Monster — are included as well as two round cards to allow for longer games up to six rounds.InElfensea, as inElfenland, young elves have to pass a special test before they are accepted as grownups. The same rules apply inElfenseaas inElfenland, except as described in the rules. The game board map is different, and the common types of transportation — dragons, unicorns, giant pigs, magic clouds, whales and rafts — differ somewhat as well. As inElfenland, these types of transportation are available in limited numbers and can be used only in specific regions. Thus, an exciting race starts among the elves to find out who will make the best use of the available transportation. The player with the most points wins. </description>

<description>A dark rift has opened, spewing monsters of the Abyss to lay siege to the Citadel of Modhelm! All hope lies on the mighty heroes who unite to defend its walls.B-Sieged: Sons of the Abyssis a fully cooperative castle defense board game that combines exciting combat action with classic resource management. In this thrilling battle, 1 to 6 players control the mighty Heroes of Modhelm, who must endure the siege of the encroaching enemies and hold out long enough for the Messenger to return with a powerful magic artifact that will break the enemy forces.During their turn, Heroes may take 3 actions. They can spend these actions to visit the various buildings inside the Citadel to get resources (such as Food, Gold, Special Abilities, and Cards), repair damaged buildings, trade cards, fight Enemies from the walls, or try to use the powerful catapult at the center of the Citadel. The Heroes must coordinate their actions well to share resources, gather vital supplies, and survive the siege.After the Heroes have acted, it’s the Monsters' turn. Each monster figure on the board will activate and perform their actions according to its rank. For 12 rounds that encompass the 4 seasons, the heroes must fight to keep the citadel safe. If the messenger can return in time with the magic artifact, the abyssal forces will be cast back into the fiery darkness.To make matters worse, a surprise disruption may summon the Avatar of the Abyss itself! This behemoth marches inexorably towards the citadel. Stop it in time, or it’ll shatter the defenses, and destroy the citadel!</description>

<description>The Undercityputs a spin on the classic dungeon crawl adventure, setting it within the vast underground labyrinth of one of the Iron Kingdoms’ most famous cities.This board game for two to four players and comes with a seven-adventure campaign. The players play one to four characters from the Iron Kingdoms universe as they try to weed out a nefarious evil that has been lurking in the Undercity of Corvis.All players will be playing on the same team and the game requires no game master. The players work together defeating enemies, achieving objectives, and gaining experience that can be used to give new skills to their characters that can be used in subsequent adventures in the campaign.The game will come with almost 40 different miniatures with 16 different sculpts. The four heroes are Milo Boggs (the alchemist), Canice Gormleigh (the gun mage), Gardek Stonebrow (a trollkin warrior), and Pog (a gobber mechanic) that controls a light warjack named Doorstop.Each character has a starting stat sheet, but players can purchase character ability cards with XP gained from the adventure to enhance and customize their characters.Combat is based on rolling dice against opposing attributes. Players will be able to use feats and abilities to give boosts to these dice rolls, similar in many ways to other games based in the Iron Kingdoms.</description>

<description>Overview:Players take on the role of an aspiring deity. They must build up a Temple, gather Faithful followers and collect powerful Relics in an attempt to wipe their opponents off the map – only one deity can reign eternal in this free-for-all of legendary proportions!Play Time:2 players (1-hour), 3 players (1.5 hours), 4 players (2-2.5 hours)Basic Play:Play follows a 4-step turn: Reveal (start), Marketplace (buy), Raid (combat), Reinforce (end).The Tile Deck, Faithful Deck and Relic Deck feed into a central board called the Marketplace.Players use Faithful (human followers) in their Temple to collect gold and defend in combat.Faithful placed in the Raiding Party can attack opposing Temples during combat.Relics (4 of which are aligned to each Fate) further increase strategic play and add variety.Players will purchase Tiles from a randomized stack (the Tile Deck) to customize their Temple, which is then arranged strategically to increase hand-size and defenses.The four fates are: Chaos, Grace, Prosperity and Wisdom, each tailored to a unique play-style.Each Fate Deck has a powerful set of 20 different cards, in theme with each of the Fates. Combat:A Raiding Party ventures into an opposing Temple, encountering Defenders and Traps along a Tile path to the Heart of the Temple, where the opposing life force dwells. Combat is resolved through dice rolls, with Defense rolling first and combining its total. Faithful played from the Raiding Party must beat defending total or they are forced to retreat. If the Temple is conquered, damage is dealt through Smiting. When an opponent’s life hits zero (20 max), they are defeated. The last remaining player has achieved immortality!</description>

<description>This newcomer fancies himself a historian; always telling stories about how our people used to live, or how some great hero from the past would deal with the crisis of the hour. It seems silly to say, but it makes the horrors around us seem more manageable; like we've beaten them before. The victory that recently seemed hopeless has become conceivable.I wonder how much truth there is in these fables. Could anyone really fabricate wondrous items like we hear about in legends? Command wild animals to do their bidding? Craft servants out of light and shadow? I've never seen such things, but I've heard of them, in tales of old...In Tales of Old, the fourth expansion to Jeremy Lennert'sDarkest Night, sends your heroes racing across the kingdom to unravel the mysteries of the holy relics' resting places.Instead of searching for keys, you now draw Mystery cards that reveal how to obtain clues to the relic's location, and perhaps some other rewards. These mysteries may lead you to explore the depths of ancient catacombs teeming with traps, or encounter an antique trader willing to part with old scrolls for the right price.Gather your knowledge, courage, and strength as you uncover the kingdom's secrets in the hopes of vanquishing darkness once and for all... </description>

<description>InRumpelstiltskin, you and a friend take the roles of fey folk who have decided to engage in a name guessing contest. You must use your magical mischief to learn your opponent's secret name while protecting your own!Players alternate taking turns. To take a turn, you play one card from your hand, perform its actions, then put it in your discard pile. Some cards let you try to win the game by guessing your opponent's secret name, i.e., the card on the bottom of their deck). Your opponent may use a reaction, but then must tell you if you guessed right or wrong. If you guessed correctly, you win! If the card you guessed is not on the bottom of your opponent's deck, play continues.</description>

<description>You have been caught looting the hoard of the dreaded Drakon. For such transgression, a fiery death should be the only appropriate response — but Drakon has decided to toy with you before she devours you. You and your rival heroes will each be released into the labyrinth, and the first hero to discover ten gold pieces will go free with his treasure. The rest of you will satisfy the dragon's hunger.In every game ofDrakon, you and your opponents must fight to stay alive in the midst of the labyrinth. On your turn, you can either move your hero to another room, or add another piece to the labyrinth, placing beneficial chambers in your own path and throwing your opponents into harm's way. But you must be cautious. The chambers of Drakon's labyrinth are filled with danger and ancient magics, not to mention the dragon herself. To navigate these deadly corridors and survive, you’ll need to be quick and careful.On every turn, you have a crucial choice to make. You can either move forward into a new chamber, or you can expand the labyrinth by playing a new chamber tile from your hand. The new chambers that you play feature unique circumstances and magical objects that you may encounter on your adventures through Drakon's lair.The majority of these chambers offer powerful effects to any hero that enters the chamber. You may gain the power to destroy any chamber in the labyrinth, or call a windstorm to carry you along, increasing your movement. You may even take command of a floating chamber and fly it to the other side of the labyrinth. Other chambers force more harmful effects on those heroes unlucky enough to enter. A room may cause you to lose a coin as you avoid the dangers within, and any hero who hears the siren song of the magical harp is forced to move into its chamber. As you and your fellow heroes play these chambers from your hand, they form a cunning maze, and only the wise can find their way out.Despite the power of these chambers, the central goal of your quest is to find gold: only by being the first player to claim ten gold can you escape the dungeon. Plenty of chambers allow you to find a coin or steal a coin from an opponent, but the gold value of coins can vary dramatically. Your most recently stolen coin may have a value of three gold or just one. Because coins are kept face-down, hiding their value, you'll never know exactly how close your opponents are to victory.Six heroes are trapped within Drakon's sadistic labyrinth, and each hero has his own unique abilities to help him survive. Each ability can only be used once per game though, making the timing of the ability incredibly important. You may play as the sorceress and escape from a most dire situation by passing through a wall. You may play as the thief and collect the gold you need at the most opportune moment by preying on another hero. You may even play as the ranger and use a burst of speed to race across the maze when necessary. No matter which hero you play in a game of Drakon, you'll need to take full advantage of your unique ability at the opportune moment if you want to grab the gold and escape from Drakon's clutches.Of course, the heroes are not alone in the labyrinth. The legendary dragon also stalks the halls and chambers of the maze, taunting any hero unlucky enough to encounter her. Certain chambers throughout the labyrinth allow you to move Drakon through the dungeon. If you can move Drakon into the same chamber as a hapless hero, that hero is immediately sent back to the entrance chamber and loses three coins, as Drakon toys with him before releasing him once more into the maze.You and your rival heroes are trapped. Your greatest threat may be Drakon or the other heroes. In this dark labyrinth, only one thing can save you: your own greed. Will you ruthlessly grab gold and undermine your opponent’s schemes before escaping to victory? Or will you fail and become just another meal for the dragon? You decide your fate, but only one hero can escape from Drakon!</description>

<description>You are a Dragon. Like all respectable dragons you must find yourself a Princess and horde some treasure. There are some nearby towns just ripe for the plunder. You must strafe these villages with your dragonfame until they submit and hand over their treasures. But of course, you're not the only Dragon out there!InDragonFlameyou will take turns placing 3 cards on to the Castle cards in the center of the table. This will create piles of cards that you will get to choose from at the end of the round. The pile you choose will also determine your turn order for the next round.Once you've taken a pile you place the cards in front of you for end game scoring. Any DragonFire cards you have acquired give you the ability to flame the villages for a area-control over these cards (more victory points).Since sometimes you may place a card face down, this becomes a game of reading the other players and choosing the right (sometimes poisoned) piles. Do you take that pile with a lot of cards and risk the minus points or just go for the safe face up treasures?There are several types of treasures to collect. You will only score 1 of the types of chests and the others count against you. Some treasures are just straight forward points. Some are even powerful magic items with special abilities.</description>

<description>InDragon Run, the players have just raided a dragon's keep, picked up a bunch of loot, and awakened the dragon. Now it's time to flee, ideally making it out with both our treasures and our lives.On each turn, a player can either advance boldly, flee cautiously, or cry like a baby. If you advance boldly, you draw a card from the location deck, which holds three types of cards: one that allows that player to either redraw or stop, one that grants new treasure from the treasure hall, and (of course) the dragon. If you draw the dragon, you lose one health point (out of two), the dragon calms down (i.e., it loses one temper point), and the location deck is reshuffled. If you're injured twice, you die and are out of the game.When fleeing cautiously, you first discard a treasure worth at least one coin, then roll a d10. If your roll is higher than the number of cards in the location deck, the dragon calms down, then you reshuffle the location deck; otherwise you must draw a card from the location deck just as when someone advances boldly. Your sacrificed treasure is still lost.When you cry like a baby, you don't draw a location card, instead discarding a treasure worth at least two coins. Having shown your obeisance to the dragon, the turn passes to the next player.Players start with four treasure cards; while some cards are worth 1-5 coins, others provide a one-shot potion or a talisman that stays in effect until the location deck is shuffled, which ends the round. Gameplay lasts from 5 to 8 rounds. Each player has a unique power that can be used once per round: the thief can steal cards from opponents, the cleric can heal opponents in exchange for treasure, etc. If the dragon loses its final temper point, the game ends and whoever holds the most valuable treasure wins; if all of the adventurers are charred to death first, then the dragon wins instead!</description>

<description>Welcome to the assembly of darkness!The Majorityis a Japanese card game to form strong political factions and gain the most money!The Majority Complete Editioncombines two games previously available only in Japan,The MajorityandThe Majority 2.The Majority:The Majorityis playable with 3 or 4 players. In a 4 player game, the game is played in teams of 2, forming a 2 versus 2 game. In this game, each player will be playing a card from his or her hand to form political parties. Cards have different special abilities as well as strengths in the political party. Players will be using these cards to form a strong and powerful party. However, in this game, having the strongest party won't make you the most money. Instead, being the second most powerful party will grant you more money! Remember though, that getting some money is always better than getting nothing. You must carefully coordinate your plays with your partner so that you and your partner will end up with the most and second most powerful party!In a 3 player game, the game is played almost identically. However, you will not have a partner, so it will be a 3 person free for all. You will need to play cleverly to ensure that you will end up with more money than your opponents!The Majority 2:The Majority 2is playable only with 2 players. In this game, a player's goal is to create more political factions with higher authorities than his or her opponent. Board members are the various residents of the pandemonium, including Witches, Demons, Dragons, Angels, and Reapers. These inhumane creatures are equipped with exciting and powerful special abilities that can aid their factions or hinder their opponents. The game has a very unique card drafting mechanics where the hand of cards are shared between the player and their opponent. Therefore, player must carefully decide when and which politicians to hire for their factions, as those left behind may comeback as a member of the opposition!</description>

<description>Elfquest's World of Two Moons is calling! Gather your elf tribe together - your very survival is at stake. Life can be difficult, even brutal, as you deal with fearful and violent humans, treacherous and manipulative trolls, and all manner of strange creatures and harsh environments.It is time to embark on an epic journey of discovery to seek and find long-hidden answers about your mythical elfin ancestors, the High Ones. Each player selects a character, gathers up their attending items, skills and allies and joins their tribe-mates to complete tasks, events and quests.There are a limited number of seasons during which you need to complete each scenario card. If you fail to do so, every member of your tribe loses resources (cards, tokens and cubes). If ever a character runs out of cubes, they are killed and removed from the game.Each scenario pulls directly from 35+ years of Richard &amp;amp; Wendy Pini's epic saga of comics and graphic novels. Sometimes your tribe will have to fight humans, negotiate with new elf tribes, travel across snow-laden mountains, mate to increase your tribe's numbers, hunt and harvest to keep everyone fed or craft new items to help in your journey.This cooperative game for 1-4 players delivers all the wonder, passion, danger, compassion and betrayal of the original best-selling series. It features the breathtaking artwork of Wendy Pini interwoven with the imaginative game design of Layman Kingsford. You will stretch your gaming and social skills as you interact with the extraordinary realm of Elfquest as you've never seen it before!</description>

<description>A new millennium has begun on your planet! Order has seized control of your lives and Chaos has lost much ground, but still lingers in the shadows. In no event can the balance of your world tip wholly towards either force, as this would spell your immediate destruction. Your world is ruled by duality. Now the time has come to awaken the Warriors of Balance.Djavha is a game with 54 cards where each player must use the powers of Ordre and Chaos as represented on each card to get rid of all of the cards in their possession. The game is one of rank and power. The first participant to get rid of all of their cards becomes the Master and the last person to get rid of their cards becomes the Damned.</description>

<description>Once more, conflict rages across the world of Aerim. You are one of the Eternals, a group of immortals forever waging war from the shadows. Call forth your champions to battle against those of your timeless foes. Harness the legacy of each champion's deeds as they echo across time to empower the next. For the Champions of Aerim, this cycle continues, as it always has and always will. For the Eternals, there is only...strife.Strife, a two-player strategy card game that plays in around an hour, is a game where you always know your opponent's options. Aside from mastering the unique combo-creating gameplay of your champions, figuring out how to outmaneuver your opponent is where the true challenge lies.Each player has the same hand of ten champions and will simultaneously play them as they fight over key locations throughout Aerim worth varying victory points. Each champion has a battle ability that's triggered during battles and a legacy ability that can be used only while on top of the legacy pile. This creates an intricate latticework of strategy for the players as each champion must be considered for not only what he can do in the current battle, but for which ability he will add to the next.Further impacting the critical decisions within the game is the Fatestone tie-breaking system. The Fatestone starts at a value of one, and whoever holds the Fatestone die loses all ties; that player may instead pass the stone to his opponent to claim a victory in that tie, but doing so raises the value of the Fatestone by one each time it is passed. At the end of the game, the player holding the Fatestone adds its final value to his victory point tally. Whichever player has the most victory points at the end of the game wins!</description>

Whether it be to collect Sungems to provide heat for the long night, recruit other denizens like Luftles to help your tribe succeed, take over an uninhabited (or inhabited cave), fight in cooperation against larger predators, protect your land. There are many scenarios and objectives to keep the game fresh.Dawn - Rise of the Occulites is a fun and accessible game that is easy to pick up, but difficult to master.</description>

<description>InDragon's Gold,each player controls a team of dragon hunters (two knights, a thief, and a wizard). Like all dragon hunters, they have only one goal: gold, silver, jewels and magic objects. As for actually killing a dragon? It's a piece of cake. But the most difficult part comes after the dragon is dead: the adventuring party has to figure out how to share the spoils.As soon as a dragon is overpowered, then some additional gems are revealed, and the players who had participated in that hunting party start a negotiation over how to divvy up the gems. If the sixty-second sand timer runs out, then no one gets treasure. When all of the dragons have been slain and the treasure claimed or discarded, the game ends and players score for their holdings, with silver and magic objects worth 1 point each, gold worth 3, the Black Diamond worth 7, and the colored gems scoring 10-15 points for those players who hold more than everyone else. (In the Advanced game, the colored gems score 8-12 points in addition to a variety bonus of 5 points for each set of different colored gems a player holds. The Black Diamond is worth 19 points [in the 2011 edition], but negates a player's score for all colored gems.)</description>

<description>Clockwork Kingdomis a game in which each player takes the role of a lord attempting to claim the throne in the wake of the king's death. To start the game, each player has a small army of loyal steam-powered automatons to do their bidding. Each player must choose where to send his servants, whether to get supplies from the market, build useful contraptions in the workshop, or even attempt to acquire powerful alchemy stones, all the while warring with opponents in a number of battlefields in an attempt to control the kingdom by force.However, players have more at their disposal than simple automatons. Throughout the course of the game, players can also recruit Alchemists, Professors, and Artificers to their cadre of loyal vassals, each with their own unique abilities. To claim the Clockwork Throne, players must make difficult decisions to outwit their opponents in an attempt to gather resources, obtain workers, manufacture contraptions, and dominate battlefields.</description>

<description>An expansion released off the back of theLords of War: Templars versus UndeadKickstarter Campaign, this expansion adds no new Units to Lords of War but instead adds two modifier decks to the base game.The Terrain Deck enables players to build custom battlefields using cards which have a number of effects on the Units placed on top of them. This includes building 'Walls' and 'Gates' which may be destroyed or landscape features such as 'Hills' which increase damage dealt by Ranged Units or 'Marshes' into which Cavalry cannot be placed.The Weather Deck meanwhile creates dynamic weather conditions, including 'Night' during which players can play two cards instead of one in their turn or 'Mist' which allows Infantry Units to deal more damage.These decks can be used together or separately, and the expansion also includes a 'Retrieve The Dragon Egg' minigame which operates much like a 'Capture The Flag' mode.</description>

<description>The Umenzi Tribesmen is the sixth faction for Battleground: Fantasy Warfare, the award-winning tabletop wargame in which cards, rather than expensive miniatures, represent your forces. The Umenzi Tribesmen draws inspiration from the great Zulu armies of earth as well as a cinematic take on Voodoo, adding a new level of magic to Battleground play. As with previous Battleground factions, the Umenzi Tribesmen is packaged in two decks. Starter decks include all the cards needed to play -- 18 units, the 30-card Command deck and two reference cards -- plus the basic rules. Reinforcement decks include 50 unit cards, including two types not found in the Starter, plus the advanced rules.</description>

Players use their judgement to pick the right character to use at the right time, and second-guess their opponent to choose when to attack and when to defend. The game is designed to be quick and easy to both learn and play, encouraging children and their parents to play together.ButArmy of Zeroalso holds a secret. The game's unusual feature is that the deck of eighty-four character cards hides a series of puzzles. The person who submits the best solution before the closing date will win a cash prize.</description>

When all players run out of Power, the Action phase ends and the next turn begins. Victory is determined by accumulating points on the Doom Track. The first player to 30 is the lone victor.Driving the strategy are a player's wish to expand his power base, and his need to accomplish six tasks to acquire his faction's spellbooks. Each faction has a unique set of monsters, spellbooks, and special abilities, and has different requirements to acquire its spellbooks. All factions have multiple strategies open to them.The base game supports 2-4 players, but with new factions and maps released as expansions it can support up to 7 players.</description>

<description>Dungeon Lords: Happy Anniversaryincludes theDungeon Lordsbase game, theFestival Seasonexpansion, stickers for food tokens, metal coins, a new "Dungeon Set-up" mini-expansion, and other items.InDungeon Lords, you are an evil dungeon lord who is trying to build the best dungeon out there. You hire monsters, build rooms, buy traps and defeat the do-gooders who wish to bring you down. Each turn, players use a hand of cards to choose where to place their worker imps. Actions vary from mining gold, hiring monsters, buying traps etc. Each action has three spots available - with each spot having different effects (e.g., mining gold lets you mine more gold in each spot). When using the cards, two cards will become locked and will not be able to be used next turn.The entire game lasts two "game years", and each year consists of four seasons (a.k.a. turns). At the start of each season, players see the heroes and events to come in the following season, allowing them to prepare. At the end of each season after the first, heroes are allocated to each player according to the players' level of evilness. Heroes range from mighty heroes to sneaky thieves. Each hero has its own power for which the player needs to prepare for. At the end of each year, the heroes travel into the dungeons to fight.Scoring in the game is based upon what you have built, the monsters you have hired and the heroes you have captured.TheFestival Seasonexpansion adds a fifth season to the year: festival season. More time to build your dungeon, but also more time for adventurers to gather a larger party. There are new monsters, rooms, and traps to prepare your dungeon for the battle, but also new nasty spells for the adventurers and sneaky bards who encourage them to perform so-called "heroic" deeds – not to mention two paladins for each year, now ready to punish up to two evil players.Would you like to push other players toward evil instead of moving yourself toward good when visiting the city? What about making an investment instead of traditional gold digging? Or what about repairing conquered tunnels or rooms instead of digging new ones? Only eight actions are still available to you, but each season one of those actions is replaced by an alternate set of spaces that offer new and intriguing options. And did we mention that it has recently become fashionable for dungeon lords to have their own personal pets?</description>

<description>InDungeon Bazar, the player merchants try to earn money by selling equipment — weapons, armor and tools — to heroes who wish to fight against an old dragon in a nearby cave. What the heroes don't know, though, is that the merchants have an agreement with the dragon as naturally they're interested in keeping their source of gold, the great lizard, alive.Each player has a personal game board, and each turn they play, then reveal a number of equipment cards. Each hero card displays that hero's desired equipment and priorities. Once the cards are revealed, the heroes buy from the cheapest stand according to their priorities as long as they have money.</description>

<description>Orcs Orcs Orcsis a game for two to four players that combines two excellent game mechanics that have not been paired before (deck building and tower defense) and has players casting spells, squashing orcs and rolling up the score in the Orc Squash Tournament.The mages start the game on top of the tower in the middle of the battlefield. The battlefield consists of six lanes, each with three sectors, radiating out from the tower. On these lanes the orcish hordes will try to charge all the way towards the tower. Your job is to defeat them before they can reach you.At the beginning of each game round players draw a fate card, which will determine which category of creatures will advance one sector towards the tower and sometimes implement a nasty rule change for that particular game round. There are three categories of orcs which differ in strength and special abilities that are conveyed to a player once an orc is defeafed.The game ends when on four lanes you run out of orcs. During the final scoring players count up their defeated orcs and multiply them by the number on the creature counter, get points for each support spell learned and subtract points for each poison card in their deck. Whoever has the most points will be declared "Master Mage"!</description>

<description>Team up with fellow wizards to vanquish the sinister monsters that lurk in the dungeon, and save the nearby village. This is a noble and honorable quest, and... oh, who are we kidding? In reality, you're a greedy wizard who is all about fame and personal gain, and your fellow wizards are cut from the same cloth! Prevail over your opponents by learning the best spells and using that knowledge to outmaneuver and kill-steal in the dungeon, so you can gain admiration of the townsfolk, fame across the realm, and achieve Pixel Glory.In the first phase, the town phase, players will be drafting spells using an auction mechanic. Players will then take their decks into the second phase, the dungeon phase, where they will work together to defeat monsters; however, only the player that deals the lethal blow will get the fame for it. There is a lot of interaction and engagement due to players fighting over learning the same spells as well as fighting over fame.</description>

<description>Each player inKorriganshas two korrigans (a.k.a. fairies or spirits) and must use them to move about the landscape, claim animal tokens in order to access other parts of the land, and eventually find the pot of gold that will become visible once the rainbow's location is revealed.In more detail, players take their first two turns to place their korrigans on the game board; with each korrigan you place, you look at the tokens in that location and keep one of them. These tokens show either gold (which possibly gives you points at the end of the game) or an animal (which allows you to pass through gates that bear that animal to reach a different landscape). From the third turn on, players use their animal tokens to move their korrigans and pick up more tokens. The final player in each round draws a rainbow token from a bag and places it in one of the rows or columns on the board; this means that the pot of gold won't appear in this row or column in the final part of the game.Once the gold is finally placed on the game board, players have a final round in which they try to reach the pot with their korrigans. If a player reaches the pot with one korrigan, he scores points equal to the gold he's collected; and if he reaches the pot with both korrigans, he scores his gold plus five points. Whoever has the highest score wins!</description>

<description>Note: This game is in Polish with some cards in English.  To be able to play the game, you'll need paste up onsome cards, and English rules can be foundhere.Once more, conflict rages across the world of Aerim. You are one of the Eternals, a group of immortals forever waging war from the shadows. Call forth your champions to battle against those of your timeless foes. Harness the legacy of each champion's deeds as they echo across time to empower the next. For the Champions of Aerim, this cycle continues, as it always has and always will. For the Eternals, there is only...strife.Strife, a two-player strategy card game that plays in around an hour, is a game where you always know your opponent's options. Aside from mastering the unique combo-creating gameplay of your champions, figuring out how to outmaneuver your opponent is where the true challenge lies.Each player has the same hand of ten champions and will simultaneously play them as they fight over key locations throughout Aerim worth varying victory points. Each champion has a battle ability that's triggered during battles and a legacy ability that can be used only while on top of the legacy pile. This creates an intricate latticework of strategy for the players as each champion must be considered for not only what he can do in the current battle, but for which ability he will add to the next.Further impacting the critical decisions within the game is the Fatestone tie-breaking system. The Fatestone starts at a value of one, and whoever holds the Fatestone die loses all ties; that player may instead pass the stone to his opponent to claim a victory in that tie, but doing so raises the value of the Fatestone by one each time it is passed. At the end of the game, the player holding the Fatestone adds its final value to his victory point tally. Whichever player has the most victory points at the end of the game wins!</description>

<description>The chief deity of the metallic dragons is Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon. He dwells in the Seven Heavens of Celestia, but often wanders the Material Plane in the magical guise of a venerable human male in peasant robes. In this form, he is usually accompanied by seven golden canaries - actually seven ancient gold dragons in polymorphed form.Bahamut seldom interferes in the affairs of mortal creatures, though he makes exceptions to help thwart the machination of Tiamat the Dragon Queen and her evil brood. Good-aligned clerics and paladins sometimes worship Bahamut for his dedication to justice and protection. As a lesser god, he has the power to grant divine spells.</description>

<description>Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasure will one day be hers and hers alone.Tiamat is a gigantic dragons whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship her - black, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws. Tiamat's most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom shes shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen's power.</description>

<description>The Witcher Adventure Gametakes players on a journey across the world ofThe Witcher, a detailed world, rich in lore and characters, fleshed out by Andrzej Sapkowski's famous series of novels, and honed byThe Witchervideo game trilogy.Players assume the roles of four distinct characters from this series: Geralt of Rivia, monster slayer; Triss Merigold, cunning sorceress; Yarpen Zigrin, dwarven warrior; and Dandelion, roguish bard. Each character has unique skills and multiple ways of overcoming obstacles, but you decide what to do during the game: Do you fight your way to victory, call on your charm, or try your hand at diplomacy? You can bring enemies around to your point of view with a sword as Geralt - or bribe them with gold and threaten to call on powerful friends as Dandelion. If a situation calls for strength in numbers, Yarpen has his own fellowship of dwarves to command, and Triss can rely on her expert skill with magic to save the day.Each character has its own deck of Development Cards, so each time you play you can discover something new by trying out varied characters and experimenting with different builds. For example, when playing as Geralt of Rivia, the main hero of the Witcher franchise, you can develop your character either by specializing in brewing and utilizing combat Elixirs, or else by growing your ability to cast powerful Witcher Signs.A variety of quests invite players to hunt monsters, earn gold and interact with the characters they meet in a web of alliances and treachery. Decide whether you’ll help the other players or look after your own interests first, and keep an eye on the progress of your friends while you carefully work your way towards victory.</description>

Each expansion can be played by adding cards to the basic game or by mixing them together if you want a completely new and crazy gaming experience.This expansion contains a mixture of new game materials, but above all it gives players access to the secrets of air magic, the freshest elemental art. Now careless heroes can twist and storm everything around them to make their situation even more interesting.Stormy Windsincludes new monsters and equipment, a new sorceress heroine, an ancient greek god as the Boss, and new maps with special rooms. You can accumulate experience points as in a real fantasy game, and power cards allow you to activate devastating air powers, such as the "Chain Lightning" spell, but beware the new monster flying ability!

<description>Demonslayer: The Siege of Mt. Kunlunis what is called a 'deck-building game,' for up to four players. The game is based on the story “Warriors of Magic Mountain.” Each player takes control of one Sect of the Kunlun Immortals, and they must compete with each other in defeating the dread forces of the Heart-Eaters. By defeating the Heart-Eaters, each player accumulates Cultivation. At the end of the game, once all the Heart-Eaters are defeated, the player with the most Cultivation is the winner.Every turn, players play a “hand” of cards, building up the player’s “ready deck” and attacking the demon enemies. In each turn, players can "obtain" a card once, and attack once. Players can obtain spells as well as obtain "meditation" cards which are used to obtain more, stronger cards. Players may also "obtain" Immortal warriors from their Immortal Roster area; Immortals are the foot-soldiers in the war against the Heart-Eaters.Each turn of the game is strategically important; one wrongly played hand can mean the difference between first and last place.There are four Sects of Immortals inDemonslayer, and each plays differently from each other. The Kunlun Sect excels at bringing high-powered Immortal warriors out quickly, each building on the other’s strength. The Qicheng sect is good at calling on reserve Immortals to join the battle. The Kongtong Sect is proficient at Alchemy; creating powerful artifacts which help the Sect in it’s battle’s against the Heart Eaters. The noble Wuyi Sect Immortal Warriors sacrifice themselves for devastating combo attacks. Every sect also has 1 Sect Leader Immortal, who provides special powers which serve to define how the sect plays.The enemy of the game are the “Heart-Eaters;” demonic warriors who have attained immortality by reveling in lustful destruction and excess. Many of the heart eaters have spiritual parasites – called “Miasma” which infect the players after slaying. However, players also sometimes attack “Treasure Beasts” which can grant players special abilities once they are won.In one "wave" ofDemonslayer, there are 8 Heart Eaters and one "Overlord;" a leader of that wave of Heart-Eaters.Demonslayer: Siege of Mt. Kunlunis not, strictly speaking, a game of inter-player competition. Players compete with each other to have the honor of being the most successful at protecting the heavens and Earth from the demon hoards. Yet, players are are essentially cooperating to defeat the enemy.This English-language version of the game already incorporates one expansion, calledThe Alchemist's Fortune. In time, we will release new expansions for you to enjoy, incorporating more players, more cards, more options, more strategy, and most of all – more fun.</description>

<description>In the far future, humanoid empires of the universe turned to an intense study of ancient civilizations that existed on a planet known as Earth. They learned that these ancients simultaneously built pyramids towards the sky and had an extensive knowledge of the stars. It was rumored that perhaps they were the original colonizers and space-farers of the first human age.Now, at the edge of a colossal black hole, a pyramid-craft known as the Zoneplex has emerged with legendary markings and glyphs of the deep past. The known empires have sent their elite warrior-monk mystics on a one-way mission to gain control of the Zoneplex, to emerge victorious and ultimately control the pathways of the universe and time itself.Zoneplexis a game that combines a tile-laying/exploration mechanism, a collaborative battle system and a zone control system to create an intriguing adventure in an alien pyramid.The game works in 2 phases with the first phase players not counting Influence points until the pyramid is completed.In phase 1 players strategically lay tiles determined by action cards to build their pathway through the Zoneplex pyramid whilst being cognizant of the Sacred Symbol card that they are bestowed with before the game begins. While building strategically players also confront creatures within the pyramid which they must collect to become worthy to enter the Eye and win the game. The players control the Zoneplex by gaining Influence points which occurs when a Player places a spirit-stone on the board. Spirit Stones not only sustain one's Influence points but can also be removed to gain bonuses in combat.In phase 2 after exploring the pyramid, the players reveal their Sacred Symbol cards and count influence points, then a cutthroat race for survival and worthiness begins as players vie to enter "The Eye of The Zoneplex" to become the decisive winner or stand their ground with the most influence points as the action cards run out.</description>

<description>This is a re-working of Reiner Knizia'sVegas.Maginoradds some cards, spells, and a different "dueling" mechanic.The theme is that players are trying to gain votes from various oracles. Maginor visits each one in turn. The player with the most influence counters at an oracle can take either the points for the oracle or the spell card there. The player with the second most influence gets whichever the first player didn't take. Spells have one-time effects that alter different aspects of the game.Influence is gained at the oracles both by playing cards and rolling a die. This gives a mix of random chance and control over the game. If a player tries to get influence in a position occupied by another player's influence counter, they must duel. This is a RPS mechanic with a twist. If both players choose an "earthbeast" in the duel, the defender wins.When all oracles are scored, the player with the most total votes wins.</description>

<description>Chaos &amp;amp; Alchemyis a fast-paced game of laboratory building and rivalry between alchemists. Players conduct an experiment each turn by rolling dice, hoping for each die to be at least as high as the shared Fortune Die. Each success lets the alchemist draw a new card from the deck or play a card from hand; each failure means a discard.Cards represent Innovations to improve the alchemist's laboratory, Misfortunes to make rivals' lives harder, Actions to immediately impact the game, and Reactions to respond to other alchemists' deeds.When an alchemist rolls doubles in an experiment, Chaos occurs and fortunes change. The experimenter re-rolls the Fortune Die, making success easier or harder to achieve.Players race to build up a laboratory sophisticated enough to turn lead into gold. The first player with 10 or more points of Innovations in the laboratory is the victor!</description>

<description>Mandrake root and scorpion tail; spongy mushroom and warty toad — these are the foundations of the alchemist's livelihood, science, and art.But what arcane secrets do these strange ingredients hide? Now it is time to find out. Mix them into potions and drink them to determine their effects — or play it safe and test the concoction on a helpful assistant! Gain riches selling potions to wandering adventurers and invest these riches in powerful artifacts. As your knowledge grows, so will your reputation, as you publish your theories for all to see. Knowledge, wealth, and fame can all be found in the murky depths of the alchemist's cauldron.In Alchemists, two to four budding alchemists compete to discover the secrets of their mystical art. Points can be earned in various ways, but most points are earned by publishing theories – correct theories, that is — and therein lies the problem.The game is played in six rounds. At the beginning of the round, players choose their play order. Those who choose to play later get more rewards.Players declare all their actions by placing cubes on the various action spaces, then each action space is evaluated in order. Players gain knowledge by mixing ingredients and testing the results using a smartphone app (iOS, Android, and also Windows) that randomizes the rules of alchemy for each new game. And if the alchemists are longing for something even more special, they can always buy magical artifacts to get an extra push. There are 9 of them (different for each game) and they are not only very powerful, but also very expensive. But money means nothing, when there's academic pride at stake! And the possession of these artifacts will definitely earn you some reputation too. Players can also earn money by selling potions of questionable quality to adventurers, but money is just a means to an end. The alchemists don't want riches, after all. They want respect, and respect usually comes from publishing theories.During play, players' reputations will go up and down. After six rounds and a final exhibition, reputation will be converted into points. Points will also be scored for artifacts and grants. Then the secrets of alchemy are revealed and players score points or lose points based on whether their theories were correct. Whoever has the most points at the end of the game wins.</description>

<description>You are the world's most fearless dragon slayers, competing to be crowned the master slayer. Your brave warrior must search far and wide for these ferocious beasts, defend yourself against its attacks and be ever ready to strike them down. Even in victory your companions may challenge your courage, demanding that you prove your valor with foolhardy audacity or cower in their mocking taunts.Dragon Slayeris a new push-your-luck game that's a deceptively difficult challenge. Like all great PYL games, the rules are simple, with you repeating the Dragon Hunt until you decide to stop. The very interesting twist is the player challenges. The ability to challenge — and rewards for passing or failing when challenged — add a dimension to everything that you do on your turn. What order do you go after dragons? When do you stop? When do you challenge? Who do you challenge? How do you get others not to challenge you?!</description>

<description>The wicked witch Grimelda has cursed the wizard Akata and imprisoned him in a magic book. As you are brave adventurers, you venture into the magic labyrinth to free the wizard – but you cannot do this without the help of its inhabitants. Visit the inhabitants and bring them certain items. You will receive coveted magic stones as a reward! The first player to fill his magic key with the magic stones and return to his starting field wins. But beware! Danger lurks everywhere...InDas Elektronik Labyrinth, designer Reiner Knizia marries his facility for electronics in board games (e.g.,Wer war's?andDie Insel) with Max J. Kobbert's long-runningLabyrinthseries of games from Ravensburger.The basic game play is the same as inThe aMAZEing Labyrinth. The board has a set of tiles fixed solidly onto it; the remaining tiles slide in and out of the rows created by the fixed tiles to make up the labyrinth. One tile stands outside the labyrinth, and on a player's turn, he takes this tile and slides it into a row, moving all the tiles and pushing one out the other side of the board, which becomes the piece for the next player to add to the maze.After inserting the tile, the player may move his pawn. Each player starts on a corner of the game board and must reach the starting location diagonally opposite. If he manages to do so, he gains a number of magic stones. A player can also acquire magic stones from the inhabitants of the labyrinth. If a player lands on an inhabitant, it tells the players what item it desires. A player who finds the item, with items being scattered throughout the labyrinth, can deliver it to the inhabitant for a reward. What's more, an inhabitant may give a visiting player a treasure chest to be delivered to another inhabitant, also for a reward.In order to complete his magic key and free the wizard, a player needs fifteen magic stones. The first player that returns to his starting location with a complete key wins.The game comes with a "book" containing electronics. This book takes care of all the interactions with the inhabitants of the labyrinth. Whenever a player interacts with an inhabitant, he pushes the corresponding buttons from the book, and the book will respond by telling the player his assignment, reward, etc.</description>

<description>Those Pesky Garden Gnomesis a non-partner trick-taking card game with a twist – in fact, possibly many twists!The game uses four suits of different lengths, with cards containing positive and negative point values. While using standard trick-taking rules – with players needing to follow suit and the highest card in the suit taking the trick and giving the lead – each player inThose Pesky Garden Gnomeshas a different goal in hand each round – and these change randomly with each new hand. Thus, a player knows only his goal and not those of the other players. A player's score for a hand is based on how close he comes to achieving his goal. The points a player scores are added to his running total, and players in a worse position in later rounds are given more options each round. After a set number of rounds, the player with the lowest score wins!</description>

<description>This game of tactics, strategy and confrontation is set in a fantasy world after the Great Depression. Each player runs a company of special agents, and their agents become teams in threes. The aim of the game is transporting the crystals and leftover artifacts (guns and transporting means!) from the mine to your own campsite and from the campsite to your home. The transport will succeed only if the team is strong and fast enough, and if you can use the transporting capacity of your men optimally. However, nobody is left alone with their problems. The competition and the robbers ensure interaction and surprises…The basic game consists of 5 rounds. Players try gaining crystals and artifacts from the central mining project (bidding for the best bunch of crystals), then in the tactically most important phase they choose their 3-card "teams" to take actions in order of their speed. On your turn you can go to the mine to take crystals to your camp; you can attack others' camps for crystals and you can transport your crystals home or to the bank from your camp. You can also collect or use the artifacts found: they can help in increasing your transporting capacity or battle power, but if you don't use them they can mean lots of points in the end of the game. At the end of the game, whoever has the most points (from crystals and artifacts at home and points from the bank) wins.</description>

<description>The king is holding a great banquet for all the nobles in the realm so that they can bathe in his splendour. Artists and troubadours will bring the necessary entertainment. It is meant to be a feast that will long be remembered!The guests attending the feast hall feel the same, for in the corners of the castle deadly plots are being developed. The guests are divided into two factions, with both planning to "dismiss" the king. One faction plans to smuggle a dagger into the feast hall to "open the king's heart to the realm" at the right time, while the other faction hopes to give the king "renewed motivation" with a poisoned drink.InThe Last Banquet, each player is a guest at the feast and needs to help his faction reach its goal and ensure that this will truly be the king's last banquet. The game includes 25 role cards, each portraying a person on the front and listing that person's skills on the back. In addition to "The Last Banquet", several other scenarios are provided in the rules that can be played with each of the roles. (GameHeads' Oliver Wolf notes, "Playing time ranges from 30 minutes up to 90 minutes or more, with more people tending to need more time to play." Also, some scenarios involve more than two factions.) Obstacle cards provide challenges for players to overcome.When a faction succeeds in its goal, all players who belong to that faction win the game.</description>

If this happens, the players must defeat Xulthûl in battle to save the Realm.Players control avatars, heroic champions imbued with unique masteries over Light. Each turn, the players move through the Realm, confronting their fate, battling creatures with deadly abilities, and engaging the services of cities and mystics in order to gather the potions, treasure, and soulshards they will need to defeat the stronghold Guardians and unseal the Wells they protect. The Light or Dark nature of each Well is revealed only when its Guardian is defeated.Meanwhile, Xulthûl’s Shadows are thickening in the Shadow Realm and will enter the game at random times in random locations, seeking the one Well that will bring about the entrance of their master.</description>

<description>Theme:"In the untamed wild, villains lurk in wait, terrors haunt dark lairs, tradesfolk seek riches, and heroes come to prove their valor." As the mayor of a frontier town, you stand in the center, eyeing the roads for talent and trouble. Will you take on challenges or hire help, develop your town or command its heroes? Your strategies, risks, and fortune can transform your village into a thriving city or forgotten ruins.Overview:Villagers and Villains is a card game with over 100 unique cards. The game is played over several rounds. Each round has 6 distinct Phases. During each Phase, all players (Mayors) have a chance to take specific actions. The Mayor who builds the most successful village wins.Game play:Villagers and Villains is a building game. In the 1st phase players recruit cards from a common pool neutral to all players. 4 classes of cards could appear in the pool: Challenges, citizens, buildings, and heroes. Each card has different game play applications and different effects on end scoring. In the 2nd phase each player has a chance to defend their town from challenges. In the 3rd phase challenges loot towns left unprotected. The 4th phase is when each town earns money. In the 5th phase money can be spent to expand a town by hiring heroes and citizens or creating buildings. The final phase resets the board for a new round of phases. The starting player changes and rounds continue until a town reaches a fixed size. At that time the game is scored.Goal:In the end each town is scored based on a variety of facets and features. Players have to assess which facet will score the most points as the game is played--and circumstances dictate.Features:The game ships with a basic and advanced version for experienced and novice gamers and special 2-player game rules. In the advanced game players gain access to the king's favor, special card powers, and pairing options for final scoring. In addition, the home site offers a variety of rules variations for added game play. While chance plays a part in the game (via a die-roll for certain elements) choices in recruiting, and how to use town's abilities and resources play a large role.The game includes:100 different playing cards (challenges, citizens, heroes, buildings)10 starting cards (5 citizens, 5 angry mobs)a die1 kings favor token1 start marker1 score pad2 punch-out sheets of gold coin tokensrules sheet.</description>

<description>Note: This game is in German.  One of 2014 Kinderspielexperten "5-to-9-year-olds" Nominee.It's a race for the treasure inKoboldbande, with the player kobolds working together to create a path to the treasure before the dragon can get its talons into the chest first.Before the game begins, players seed the 6x8 game board with four keys and a candy tile by rolling two dice — one color, and another symbol — and placing the tiles on the appropriate locations on the game board. Shuffle the 27 path tiles and 10 dragon tiles together.On a turn, a player draws a tile. If it's a dragon tile, she places it on the first empty space on the dragon path; if a path tile, she places it at the end of a path already on the board. (The first path tile is placed in the upper-left square of the game board, while the treasure is below the lower-right square.) If the path is placed on a key, the players claim the key. If the path crosses the candies, the players can place one dragon tile on the candies, delaying the dragon on its way to the treasure.Once the players have collected three keys, they can then lay a tile on the treasure chest — and if they reach the treasure before the dragon does, they win!</description>

Will "Oh my glob – look out!" be the last thingAdventure Timefans hear from Princess Bubblegum? Or will Finn and Jake save the day with a sturdy sword and a hearty "Slamacow!"?Munchkin Adventure Timeis both a standalone game and an expansion for other titles in the vastMunchkinfamily.Munchkinis a satirical card game based on the clichés and oddities ofDungeons and Dragonsand other role-playing games. Each player starts at level 1 and the winner is the first player to reach level 10. Players can acquire familiarD&amp;amp;Dstyle character classes during the game which determine to some extent the cards they can play.There are two types of cards - treasure and encounters. Each turn the current players "kicks down the door" by drawing an encounter card from the deck. Usually this will involve battling a monster. Monsters have their own levels and players must try and overcome it using the levels, weapons and powers they have acquired during the game or run away. Other players can chose to help the player or hinder by adding extra monsters to the encounter. Defeating a monster will usually result in drawing treasure cards and acquiring levels. Being defeated by a monster results in "bad stuff" which usually involves losing levels and treasure.</description>

<description>HERO versus GUARDIAN: A Game of Dungeon Craft is a 2-4 player card- and dice-based strategy game that takes 45-90 minutes to play. The game has two distinct roles: the role of the Guardian who builds a dungeon and the role of the Hero who builds a party of adventurers to loot the dungeon built by the Guardian.At the start of the game the Guardian secretly designs a dungeon using a set of 16 room cards. Additional room cards are set aside and drawn from as the game progresses. There are 4 basic room types: Traps, Brutes, Evil and Magic. Brute and Evil rooms are more common and Magic and Trap rooms less common. Each room in the game is unique and has specific ways in which it can assist in the dungeon defense. For example, some rooms, like the RUST BEAST, destroy items, others, like the PRISON CELL, give the HERO player an addition adventurer if the room is captured by the HERO. In addition, there are empty rooms that when coupled with other rooms create a modifier to the chance of that room being overtaken. The Treasure Vault is the most valuable of those rooms and the goal is to keep the adventurers from finding and capturing it. Once the Guardian places entrances outside the dungeon, the game begins.Within a round, players spend tokens to take actions in an alternating sequence. The game combines elements of chance with your ability to read your opponent's strategy. The Guardian and Hero do not HAVE to take an action and can pass and wait to see what the other is doing, however, each round the Guardian has last option which means he or she can act last forcing the hero to either act, or end their turn and turn over all but 1 of their action tokens. In addition, the Hero has first option, meaning if both players wish to act first in a round, the Hero gets to go first.Each player has action tokens to spend on a variety of actions. Players use tokens to make plays during a round. After all players have spent their tokens, a new round begins with a new set of tokens.The Heroes use tokens to prepare adventurers, and move them through the dungeon. Actions include: scouting a room (a less lethal option but slower and thus can waste precious time), venturing a room (a potentially lethal action where the hero charges adventurers into a room), play a card (spell, item or adventurer), draw a card, retreat, or pass. Heroes earn points by defeating rooms. The Guardian uses action tokens to build more rooms into the dungeon, alter room locations in the dungeon, create dungeon effects to slow down the Hero's progress, or draw cards from the dungeon deck. Each card drawn brings the game closer to the end, because when the dungeon deck is emptied the game ends. The Guardian earns points by capturing adventurers and their gear, and by keeping his dungeon rooms from being captured. The game ends either when the Guardian has drawn all the dungeon cards or when the Hero captures the Treasure Vault.A major component of the game is how the Hero moves through the dungeon and captures rooms. The Hero must enter from one of the 2 entrances, and then must always move to rooms that are adjacent (not DIAGONAL) to the entrance, or adjacent to any cleared room connected to the entrance by other cleared rooms. To clear a room the Hero uses action tokens to form a party. Selecting between 1 and 4 of his adventurers with skills suited for the room at hand. The Hero can save time by charging into an unknown room or use action tokens to scout the room and then pick the best party for the job. The advantage of charging is that it saves time and throws off the Guardian, however, it can mean certain death. Scouting is safer, but eats precious time. The Hero is trying to put the best adventurers in the rooms most suited to their skills—while the Guardian tries to ambush and surprise the Hero with rooms that challenge the adventurers. This is where spells (for the Hero) and Dungeon Effects (for the Guardian) help tip the scales of a close combat. The 4 basic Adventurers WARRIOR, ROGUE, WIZARD, and CLERIC each have a room they are best at defeating. However, they are also capable and somewhat skilled in other rooms. In addition they each have a power which gives them strategic advantages, for example the warrior is better at venturing, the rogue at scouting, the wizard can cast spells without eating action points, and the cleric can save party members by sacrificing himself. Using their skills and talents at the right time in a well balanced group can mean the difference between a wipe-out and a victory. Of course, the Guardian can see the party composition and their equipment, but the Hero cannot see what is in the rooms. So the Guardian is constantly shifting and bolstering his rooms to create the most havoc for the party at hand.Equipment also scores points for the Guardian if captured, but is important to boost the adventurers skills vs. various rooms. It also takes time (action tokens) to equip. The advantage of the bonus vs. the consumption of time becomes a key strategic choice.In a multi-player game there are multiple Heroes who each take a turn in sequence against the Guardian. Each Hero builds a party of adventurers and equips them separately. In the end if the Heroes have more combined points they win as a team against the Guardian. The game currently can play 1 to 3 Heroes vs. 1 Guardian.</description>

<description>In a faraway land, the Elves, Dwarves, Orcs, and Hobgoblins stand on the brink of war. After years of failed peace negotiations, they have finally decided to take up arms and stand ready to fight – which is great news for you because you'll be selling them their weapons.Battle Merchants is an economic game set in a fantasy land in which players manufacture four different weapons, then sell them to various warring races. Demand for each type of weapon differs throughout the game, but a well-crafted weapon will last longer.On each turn, players can forge weapons, sell a weapon, upgrade craft (to build better weapons), or take a Kindom Card (for special powers); for players with a high-enough level of craft, a fifth action is available: forge and sell a weapon in the same turn. Players earn money by selling weapons, and it's permitted (nay, encouraged!) to sell your weapons to both sides of the same battle. The game takes place over four seasons in one game year. At the end of each season, the races fight with the weapons that the players sold. Weapons are at risk of being destroyed in battle, and surviving weapons earn money for surviving. After all, someone has to get paid to sharpen all of those weapons...</description>

<description>The card deck in Seventh Hero consists of 77 cards, with each card representing one of seven different heroes. Players each start with two random heroes, and each hero has a special power that can be activated once. Each turn, a player sends a card from his hand face down to the next player, who can choose to take it or pass it on. If he takes it, he adds it to his group of heroes, but if it's a hero he already has, both hero cards are sent to the discard pile. Before sending a hero away, the player must obey the current round's limitations, such as the card must be odd or must be below or above a certain number.The first player to collect six of the seven heroes wins.</description>

<description>TSCHAK!' is a card game in which everybody gets to play with exactly the same hands. But who will be the most successful in avoiding the troglodytes and bigger monsters, while going for the fattest treasures, or even better, the legendary rings of power?The card deck in TSCHAK! is composed of twelve wizards (blue), twelve warriors (green), twelve dwarfs (red) and four artifacts (purple). Before the first round, a player receives three wizards, warriors and dwarfs and one artifact. (When playing with fewer than four players, deal out hands to virtual players; these are not used during the current round.) Set up the keep by placing one monster and one treasure tile face up on each of the three levels.Players now assault the keep, trying to avoid the monsters and claim treasure. On the first level, players choose one card from their hand, reveal it, choose another, reveal it, choose a third, and reveal it. A player must create a team of adventurers with three different colors, and the strengths of these teams (the sum of the cards' values) are then compared. (The chameleon wizard with a ? equals the strongest wizard on the table. The artifact doubles the weakest character on your team.) The weakest team gets the monster card, which costs points, and the strongest team gets the treasure card, usually positive points. Ties are broken in favor of the strongest wizard, then in favor of the wizard with the wand, then the strongest warrior, and so on.On the second level, players reveal one card, then a pair of cards, then compare strengths. On the third level, players reveal three cards at the same time. Players then compare the last card in hand, gaining 0-3 gold depending on the strength of that final card.Once all ten cards have been played, each player passes his whole hand to his left neighbour, a new dungeon is created, and you now play with the same cards as the player sitting to your right. After four rounds, the game ends and players tally their points. Some treasures and monsters are worth a set number of positive or negative points; others are worth the square of the number of them you've collected (whether positive or negative); additional treasures have special abilities, like eliminating one monster card from the tiles you've collected. The player with the highest score wins.Good hand management, double-guessing, a tad of luck, and the victory is yours!</description>

<description>Magnum Opus is a deck-building game in which each player is an Alchemist trying to be the first and only scientist to complete their life's great work by successfully fabricating the ultimate alchemical substance– the Philosophers' Stone.Unlike most victory point-oriented deck-building games, Magnum Opus is goal-oriented and plays more like a traditional card game but with a deck-building twist. Players collect different alchemical ingredients, called reagents, over the course of the game and combine them in a series of experiments in order to discover the mysteries of the Philosophers' Stone. The Discovery Matrix is where all of these experiments are conducted and the random selection and placement of Research and Discovery cards in the matrix insures that no two games are ever the same.Earn the gold you need to purchase your reagents, gain experience from your failures and knowledge from your successes, transmute the physical and mystical elements into the Philosopher's Stone and you will go down in history for your Magnum Opus.</description>

<description>A game of greedy invading Knights and an Ogre protecting its turf and treasure. In Ogre Castle, three players become knights invading a castle in search of treasure, while a fourth player becomes the Ogre, owner of the castle and the treasure. The Ogre seeks to repel these home invaders and save its goods through magic and sword-play.Ogre Castle is definitely BEST with four players...but it CAN be played with 3 players. Just make these adjustments...(1) There will be two Knights and one Ogre. (2) The Ogre places only the gems matching the Knight colors. (3) Give the two Knights 4 armor chips each at the start of the game.(4) Adjust the Ogre's goal to getting 4 gems of any color.(5) The player who begins a battle draws a magic scroll card when they move away from the battle.</description>

<description>Fantasy Frontier is a fantasy board game of airships and exploration for 2 to 4 players with a playing time of 45 to 90 minutes. Each player controls a unique airship with a crew of pioneers. Players manage the actions of these pioneers each turn in an effort to scout the land, gather resources, construct townships, and even battle it out in aerial combat. Creating geographic patterns via tile placement, the players will develop a new world each time they play. Players compete to be the first to score the required number of victory points to win the game. Points are scored by building townships, completing geographic patterns, and fighting their rivals in airship battles!Every turn, players must carefully manage the actions of five workers, which can be assigned the following tasks:Piloting the Airship - Moving their airship token around the board.Research &amp;amp; Development - Drawing map cards with geographic patterns and discovering development cards to improve their airships.Scouting the Land - Drawing terrain tiles to place on the map to expand the community game board.Gathering Resources - Landing the airship and exiting the workers to collect food, wood, stone and gold, with these resources being used to improve the performance of workers and to build townships.Construct a Township - Landing the airship and disembarking the workers to build a township, which provides a reoccurring resource stream and is worth victory points.Aerial Combat - Engaging in airship battles with other players to slow their progress and potentially score victory points.Repair Ship Damage - Repairing the damage taken in battle.Fantasy Frontier is a unique gaming experience, blending a peaceful Euro play-style with the optional take-that element of combat, creating a game unlike any other.</description>

<description>With the Ghost Stories: White Moon expansion, the monks have an extra task to deal with: rescuing the villagers themselves from the ghosts.During setup, three villagers tokens are placed on all village tiles but one. The Moon Portal is placed on the remaining tile (the center tile for normal difficulty, on the side for harder difficulty, in a corner for masochistic players). Villagers can follow monks when they move. To rescue a villager, you have to bring him to the Moon Portal and take a special rescue action on that tile.Villagers come in families of 1, 2 or 3 members. When an entire family is rescued, you get the family's reward. Small families give small rewards (like an extra Qi, or an artifact that can move the other monks to your tile), large families give large rewards (like a sword that lets you turn one die to white during each exorcism, or an armor that cancels the ghosts' come-into-play effects).Unfortunately, some ghosts are able to kill villagers. Each time a villager gets killed, the players suffer the family's curse (which can go from annoying -like having a tao token removed from the game- to downright brutal -like having a extra Wu-Feng incarnation come into play-). Villagers also die if their tile is haunted. Haunters also force villagers to flee (villagers that cannot flee are killed).</description>

<description> In Vampire Werewolf Fairies you try to become four different types of people -- Vampires, Werewolves, Witches, and Fairies. The goal of the game is to collect objects to help you or hurt your opponents, and to become types that can use those objects. You can play as multiple types. At the end of the game, a fast-paced lightning round can make or break the winner.This is a game for 2-6 players. Or, it can be combined with Zombie Ninja Pirates and played with up to 10 players.There are 3 kinds of cards. Type cards give you points if you are that type at the end of the game. Action cards will allow you to play a quick action, such as become a Type (like the "Bite" card, which lets you become a Vampire), or remove a Type from another player (like "Hair Remover", to remove a Werewolf type). Finally, Object cards you want to try to collect, and will give you points if you are a type that can use that Object. For example, "Sparkles" are +3 points for Fairies, but -3 points for Vampires, because we all know that real Vampires *don't* sparkle.Integrates with:Zombie Ninja Pirates</description>

One final hope before the last of their race would flow like the river into the ocean of history, gone and forgotten. It was the sages of the Order of Gamelyn who answered their prayers. They provided a new perspective on unity, and a way of life that would welcome peaceful members of any faction. A utopia for all. With very few options and a will to survive, this world alliance became an inevitable truth in the eyes of many of the factions' leaders. Even factions who hated one another had nothing left but each other. Under the guidance of the Order of Gamelyn, a Capital City was chosen and factions from all over the world came to call this city their new home. At last, the world was at peace... but not for long. A great storm is coming and in the darkness of the mist, there be demons.</description>

<description> In Arcadia Quest, players lead guilds of intrepid heroes on an epic campaign to dethrone the vampire lord and reclaim the mighty Arcadia for their own. But only one guild may lead in the end, so players must battle against each other as well as against the monstrous occupying forces.Arcadia Quest is a campaign-based game for 2 to 4 players, where each player controls a guild of three unique heroes, facing off against the other players and the various monsters controlled by the game. Players need to accomplish a series of quests in order to win each scenario and choose where to go next in the campaign.Players are able to choose the path their campaign takes, navigating through six out of eleven available scenarios, so each time the campaign is played it can have a different configuration of scenarios. As the campaign progresses, the heroes are able to acquire new weapons, equipment and abilities that give them powerful options to tackle the obstacles ahead. Furthermore, by fulfilling specific quests in a scenario, players unlock exclusive features in subsequent scenarios.</description>

<description>Helvetia: a country in evolution, divided between the surrounding Empires who claimed taxes and allegiance. Primitiva was the first to wake up and decide to fight to obtain independence. The other regions followed their example: Luserna, Zugriga, Berena, Friburga, etc. However, between year 1 of unification and the day of the nation, several centuries went by with alternating periods of war and diplomatic peace, troubled and bloody times which you will discover in Unita!</description>

<description>Climb aboard your trusty steed and lift off for the race of your life! The players race their dragons on a course in a deep and winding canyon. You have some magic to use to aid your cause, or hinder your opponents, but the real test is your skill at maneuvering your dragon through the course to reach the finish line ahead of the others. Players choose their speeds on each round secretly, but then must move at that speed, even if other dragons or canyon walls are in the way.The movement system gives players more maneuverability at lower speeds than at higher, so you cannot turn your dragon on a dime unless you are going very slowly - an important consideration in those hairpin turns!The track is made of two-sided tiles, so players can design their own races and change them every race to keep things fun and exciting!</description>

<description>Over one hundred years ago, L. Frank Baum introduced the world to the wondrous Land of Oz. Now, experience these familiar characters, fantastic locations, and disturbing creatures as never before imagined.The Card Game of Oz introduces an innovative new game system called the Storyline Game System™ that adds strategy to your challenging and fun adventures through Oz. Each player takes on the role of an author attempting to construct the best story in the world of Oz. During the game, players will attempt to bring together objects, characters and locations that are appropriate together – for example, the Tin Woodman and his Oil Can – while avoiding hazards like the field of poppies and terrible beasts and villains like the Kalidahs or the Wicked Witch of the West.Each round players roll a special set of dice to determine the number of points they have for drawing and playing cards. The number of dice increases during the game, allowing the game to scale naturally while you play. The game ends when a player is able to move a Prime character – that is, one of the main characters of the story – from her Title card all the way to The End, but doing so is no simple race because the character who triggers the endgame is worth no points toward victory.Featuring hundreds of fascinating characters, events, and vistas, Oz is a world that has stood the test of time. Construct an iconic tale that is all your own!</description>

<description>The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game is a cooperative adventure game in which the players attempt to complete a scenario, each with three heroes of their choice and a deck of allies, events and attachments to support them. Each round, players send their heroes and allies to quest or to fight with enemies that engage them. However, as the heroes and allies exhaust after questing, defending, or attacking, the players' options are typically insufficient to deal with everything at once. Therefore, players need to determine whether it is more urgent to quest and make progress in the scenario while the enemy forces gain power, or to take down enemies while making no progress, not knowing what will come next.The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game is the base game of a Living Card Game for which new adventure packs are released monthly. The base game contains three scenarios, twelve famous characters from the works of J.R.R. Tolkien (including Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Denethor and Eowyn), and four pre-constructed player decks. Players can either use one of these decks or construct their own deck to increase their chances to be succesful in the more challenging scenarios. The monthly adventure packs contain a new scenario, a new hero, and new player cards to be used in their deck. The base game is for 1-2 players, but with an additional base game the scenarios can be played with up to four players.Although this game is set in Tolkien's Middle Earth, the scenarios do not represent scenes from the books, but rather take place in the seventeen years from Bilbo's birthday until Frodo's departure from the Shire.</description>

<description>Note: This is not a standalone game and you need the base game Romance of the Nine Empiresto play.This description's a bit tricky, so let's take it in stages...Countermay: The Tapestry of Worlds, the crossroads of civilizations beyond imagining. After a thousand years of war, Countermay is dying. Battles, curses, extraterrestrial parasites, demonic influence, and other hazards have ruined much of the planet. The food is running out, and the threat of starvation looms. The only way to save Countermay is to seize undisputed control. Until then, armies march, fed with the ever-dwindling food as they churn farmland into mud with their boots.In the game, players assume command of one of the vastly different warring factions — including steampunk aliens, displaced WWII-era American GIs, or a risen empire of the undead — to expand, glorify, or defend their empires.The plot of the 2013 movie The Gamers: Hands of Fate revolves around the fictitious game of Romance of the Nine Empires. Within the movie itself, AEG was the publisher of the game, but as a result of Kickstarter funding for the film, it decided to create a real-life version of R9E, as an expandable card game.Romance of the Nine Empires: Arcane Fire is the first expansion to the card game featured in The Gamers: Hands of Fate. This box contains a complete play-set of cards necessary to build two new factions, as well as brand new cards for the five existing factions of Countermay.</description>

<description>The once proud and strong Blue Moon City has been plunged into chaos. The Golden Dragon has fallen, the Holy Crystal of Psi has shattered, and the old King has drawn his last breath. Worse, Blue Moon, the creator of all things, has vanished and Blue Moon City is left without a ruler.Now the three elemental dragons – the only divine creatures remaining in the world – guard the fragments of the Crystal. The two royal heirs, Prince Roland and Princess Elinor, vie for the crown. The peoples of Blue Moon City may not know whom to follow, but whoever can rally them and claim the throne will gain the power to restore the Holy Crystal of Psi and perhaps convince Blue Moon himself to return.Prepare to battle for the throne and restore peace to the city in Blue Moon Legends, a collected version of Blue Moon, Reiner Knizia's classic card game for two players! In Blue Moon Legends, you will gather the allegiance of one of the peoples of Blue Moon City, then lead them in a series of fights against another people. By winning these fights, you aim to attract the fickle attentions of the elemental dragons and win your way to the throne of the city.Players can either play the game straight out of the box with decks or strategically customize the perfect deck to take down their opponent. With hundreds of cards from which to choose, no two games will be the same. Blue Moon Legends contains all cards from award-winning designer Reiner Knizia's Blue Moon card game in a single box.</description>

<description>One night on the outskirts of the towering magic mountains the shadow of a dragon appears. Now everything is in turmoil, and people are going to search in the depths of the mountain range for its hiding place. This task won't be easy, however, as without the proper items from the village you'll have no chance of defeating the creatures waiting to be found in the dungeon. Take too long to collect the sword, shield and dragon antivenom required, though, as others might have already found the magic items or treasure of the dragon by then.In DrachenSchatten, everyone is in the village and the dungeon looking for different objects, treasures and creatures, and they'll need to perform the action or function of the different items so they can reach their goal without being defeated by dragons and hydras along the way.</description>

<description>A war game that fits in the pocket!When pressed for time and table space and the hankering for battle hits, this is the perfect remedy - and it is portable!Tiles represent troops and troops make up units in your army: just determine the size of the battle and create your own army from a pool of existing troops.Each tile hits on certain rolls, and some can only melee while others can shoot. Some tiles also have special traits which can affect their whole unit or their whole army.Armies fight in three sectors - the battlefield. The goal is to eliminate at least half the value of your opponent's army.Pocket Battles: Elves vs. Orcs is the second game in the series of "Pocket Battles", after Pocket Battles: Celts vs. Romans.The series is designed to have each army fully compatible with any other, so it will be possible, for example, to fight with orcs against Romans, or to have a mixed army of elves and Celts.The basic rules of the game are fairly simple; two armies face each other in battle. The armies are split into three columns and two rows. Players must decide, at the start of the game, how many points they will give to their armies, determining how many points it will take to defeat the opponents army. (At least half of the points).On you turn; you have to choose which faction of your army you will send off to battle! Attacks are made by using Order Tokens. If no Order Tokens are present on a unit, it costs just 1 token to issue orders to that unit. Issuing orders to the same unit in the same Battle Round would cost you the number of tokens present on the unit, plus 1. (So if there is one token on you unit, it would cost you two more tokens; if you had three, it would cost you four tokens, and so on).After a round of battle, you may choose to redeploy you units. (Units may move from the back of the row to the front of the same row, from the back of a row to the back of and other row, or from the front of a row to the front of and other row). Redeployment will not cost you any Order tokens.The battle is over when one army defeats the other.</description>

<description>Auf Heller und Pfennig takes participants to a medieval marketplace that looks remarkably like a plain matrix for square tiles. Each turn, players place tiles onto the board that modify (either positively or negatively) the amount of money to be made by the shops that share that tile's row or column. Three times the board is filled with tiles and shop money is earned, after which the player with the most money wins.</description>

<description>Red November is a cooperative game in a gnomish attack submarine where everything is going wrong. The sub is descending and the water pressure increasing, the nuclear reactor is overheating, the nuclear missile launchers are pre-igniting, fires and water leaks are everywhere, there's a giant Kraken looming nearby and there’s very little oxygen and vodka left. While the storyline feels more and more like a disaster movie, the players must get organized to solve the problems, divide the tasks among themselves to minimize the risks, and sometimes accept to sacrifice themselves for the common cause.The game is played on the map of the submarine. The conditions in the submarine are represented by three disaster tracks: Asphyxiation, Heat and Pressure. During the game, these conditions get worse, and if anyone of them reaches its maximum value, the submarine is lost. In addition, various emergencies can occur which have to be dealt with swiftly, or they'll also lead to the loss of the submarine.Each turn, a player can move to a new location, and perform some action there. Such an action can be repairs (which will improve conditions on the sub and/or fix emergencies), removing obstacles (unblocking hatches, removing flooding or extinguishing fires) or stocking up on equipment (which will help with later actions). Each action is paid for with time. The more time a player spends on an action, the greater the chance of success. After each player's turn, a number of events will happen; the more time was spent, the more events will occur. Such events will be the worsening of conditions in the submarine, or the triggering of emergencies.</description>

<description>InDragon's Gold,each player controls a team of dragon hunters (two knights, a thief, and a wizard). Like all dragon hunters, they have only one goal: gold, silver, jewels and magic objects. As for actually killing a dragon? It's a piece of cake. But the most difficult part comes after the dragon is dead: the adventuring party has to figure out how to share the spoils.As soon as a dragon is overpowered, then some additional gems are revealed, and the players who had participated in that hunting party start a negotiation over how to divvy up the gems. If the sixty-second sand timer runs out, then no one gets treasure. When all of the dragons have been slain and the treasure claimed or discarded, the game ends and players score for their holdings, with silver and magic objects worth 1 point each, gold worth 3, the Black Diamond worth 7, and the colored gems scoring 10-15 points for those players who hold more than everyone else. (In the Advanced game, the colored gems score 8-12 points in addition to a variety bonus of 5 points for each set of different colored gems a player holds. The Black Diamond is worth 19 points [in the 2011 edition], but negates a player's score for all colored gems.)</description>

<description>It is the end of the Bronze Age! A new era begins. Only recently have you discovered how to extract iron from the ore in the peat bogs, and it's best to use your new discovery before others use it against you. As a Teutonic lord, your duty is to ensure your family line is preserved and that your land prospers and grows. Of course, every other lord seems to be thinking the same thing. The gods grant favors both to control creatures and to aid your goals. Make the proper sacrifices to the Æsir to appease their whims, and you will win the game.In Asgard's Chosen, you build armies to achieve the desires of the gods. Each god has a request and will help you to gain ground. You use the favor of the gods to aid your cause, and in return you appease their desires. In order to win you will need to appease the various gods in your deck. Appeasing gods requires dramatic losses to your position or the composition of your deck. When you appease the appropriate number of gods, the game ends, and whoever has appeased the most gods wins.The game board is composed of different landscape tiles: Mountains, Forest, Hills, Scrub, Bog, and Lakes. Each tile contains two different terrain types and an enchanted land. Players will create the board in the beginning of the game by joining the tiles together. City tiles are used to fill in some of the open square spaces on the map not used by enchanted lands. There are a number of different kinds of cards in the game: God Cards, Creature Cards, Town Item Cards, Enchanted Item Cards, and Event Cards. Players build a deck with cards to take over land and to battle each other.Asgard's Chosen plays with 2-4 players, and includes both a solitaire version and a two-player co-op version.</description>

<description>Myth is a fully co-operative fantasy game. Players take on the role of one of 5 different heroes working together to defeat the Darkness. Each hero has a different skill set which represented by a unique deck of cards. Players spend Action Points by using cards. Once a certain amount of Action Points have been spent the Darkness fights back by activating monster lairs, spawning monster captains and eventually the Boss.A complete game in Myth is called a Story. Each Story is played over three Acts. Acts can be played sequentially, or can be split up over three different game sessions.Players' avatars within a Story are called Heroes. Myth Heroes are clothed in immense power, able to reave all but the mightiest foes. However, this power must be balanced lest the Darkness take too much notice. Players must weigh their actions against the Threat each will bring, with the consequences of awakening more evil and bringing doom on the party's endeavors. And be careful they must, as the Darkness is formidable and eager to snatch glory from the valiant.Heroes are controlled through an intuitive Hero Deck (videos for each Hero can be found in the Game Play Videos section below). Each deck plays uniquely and allows players more freedom of action and the ability to truly impact the Story each and every Act. Yet, cooperation is the key to victory and bloody fortune. Players must communicate, interact, and assist each other or surely the Darkness will cover all.Myth is a fully cooperative game. There is no player controlling the Darkness. The Darkness is governed by a set of rules unique to each Boss Deck and is activated through Hero actions. If the Heroes get overzealous, then the Darkness pushes back by activating Lairs, spawning Captains, and punishing the Heroes with devious Events. If the Heroes take a more subtle approach, then the Darkness reacts by reducing the potential for treasure and rewards. Without the treasures and equipment to upgrade, the Heroes will find each Act more difficult and eventually fail. The dynamic nature of the Darkness really lends a more fluid feel to the Story. Players aren't being driven by properties out of their control, nor are they being shepherded by a person whose skill has a direct impact on the enjoyment of the game.</description>

<description>The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game - The Hobbit: Over Hill and Under Hill is the first Saga Expansion for The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game and gives players the chance to participate directly in the thrilling narrative laid out by J.R.R. Tolkien in his beloved classic. Its characters, enemies, and scenarios are drawn directly from the first half of the novel. The three new scenarios in The Hobbit: Over Hill and Under Hill can be played one at a time, or they can be linked to form a campaign that allows players to relive Bilbo's dramatic story arc!Bilbo Baggins is included as a hero and adds a new sphere of influence to the game: the Baggins sphere. Baggins sphere tokens can be used not only to pay for Baggins sphere and neutral cards, but they can be used to get yourself out of sticky situations via a number of game effects that change with each scenario. While Baggins can gain resources and take actions like other heroes, he is so central to the story that if he leaves play, the players automatically lose.</description>

<description>In all cultures there are mythical characters that protect people and help them to solve their problems. Those characters often take the human form with wings and we call them Guardian Angels or RAGAMI.In this game, each player will play the role of a RAGAMI, winged human form, that travels around inside a city - the board. In this city, there are always people with problems, with their own internal conflicts, that need your help. There are also holy men and demons that can help or oppose to solving these conflicts.The objective of the game is to achieve the highest possible number of Virtue Points (VP). There are several ways to get VP, and consequently there are several strategies one can follow to win the game: solve conflicts, cause demons to disappear, help other RAGAMI, to be the RAGAMI who has solved the highest number of conflicts, etc.But helping people to solve their conflicts is what worths more VPs, and for this you need to have Points of Strength. As many as the strength of the conflict you're trying to solve, which can go from 1 to 6. There are several ways to get Points of Strength: white cubes, cards, holy men, the help of another RAGAMI, or a die.There are Action Dies (which allow to execute a certain number of actions, and it's placement will be made by the last player in the turn order) and there are Action Cards (that may be acquired during the game). In his play, Player can do one of the following actions: move his RAGAMI, move the holy men and the demons, pick cards or solve conflicts.Game ends in the turn when the places of conflicts ends or when a player hit's the 30 points score mark.Game to 2 to 4 players, 10 years up, 60 - 90 min.</description>

<description>"The end of her regency is nigh. It's time to clear the way for a new bearer of the burden. She will keep a wary eye on the novices representing their Orders and trying to win her favor. Eventually, she will have to come to a decision. Which Order will prove itself worthy to decide on her successor? There will be a new Moon Priestess and she will bear the title: LUNA.""LUNA" is the title of the Moon Priestess, and before her very eyes, each of the up to four Orders competes for the right to decide on her successor. The players are the heads of the Orders who try to convince the Priestess of themselves. Over the course of six rounds, they need to collect as many influence points as possible by skillfully placing their novices to achieve that goal.The players move their novices over seven islands surrounding a temple island. The novices are placed according to the "worker movement" principle, i.e. they aren't placed at the beginning of a round, but instead start where they ended the round before. Thus, novice movement is an important part of a round: Only if you're in the right place at the right time, you'll gain the deciding influence points. You'll have to build new shrines, work at the temple, and participate in the Priestess' divine services. But don't forget to recruit additional novices or win the favor of the local Priests; these are vital means to prepare and combine the diverse actions.</description>

<description>With the Ghost Stories: White Moon expansion, the monks have an extra task to deal with: rescuing the villagers themselves from the ghosts.During setup, three villagers tokens are placed on all village tiles but one. The Moon Portal is placed on the remaining tile (the center tile for normal difficulty, on the side for harder difficulty, in a corner for masochistic players). Villagers can follow monks when they move. To rescue a villager, you have to bring him to the Moon Portal and take a special rescue action on that tile.Villagers come in families of 1, 2 or 3 members. When an entire family is rescued, you get the family's reward. Small families give small rewards (like an extra Qi, or an artifact that can move the other monks to your tile), large families give large rewards (like a sword that lets you turn one die to white during each exorcism, or an armor that cancels the ghosts' come-into-play effects).Unfortunately, some ghosts are able to kill villagers. Each time a villager gets killed, the players suffer the family's curse (which can go from annoying -like having a tao token removed from the game- to downright brutal -like having a extra Wu-Feng incarnation come into play-). Villagers also die if their tile is haunted. Haunters also force villagers to flee (villagers that cannot flee are killed).</description>

<description>Ghost Stories is a cooperative game in which the players protect the village from incarnations of the lord of hell – Wu-Feng – and his legions of ghosts before they haunt a town and recover the ashes that will allow him to return to life. Each Player represents a Taoist monk working together with the others to fight off waves of ghosts.The players, using teamwork, will have to exorcise the ghosts which will appear during the course of the game. At the beginning of his turn, a player brings a ghost into play and places it on a free spot, and more than one can come in at the same time. The ghosts all have abilities of their own – some affecting the Taoists and their powers, some causing the active player to roll the curse die for a random effect, and others haunting the villager tiles and blocking that tile's special action. On his turn, a Taoist can move on a tile in order to exorcise adjacent ghosts or to benefit from the villager living on the tile, providing it is not haunted. Each tile of the village allows the players to benefit from a different bonus. With the cemetery, for example, Taoists can bring a dead Taoist back to life, while the herbalist allows to recover spent Tao tokens, etc. It will also be possible to get traps or move ghosts or unhaunt other village tiles.To exorcise a ghost, the Taoist rolls three Tao dice with different colors: red, blue, green, yellow, black, and white. If the result of the roll matches the color(s) of the ghost or incarnation of Wu-Feng, the exorcism succeeds. The white result is a wild color which can be used as any color. For example, to exorcise a green ghost with 3 resistance, you need to roll three green, three white, or a combination of both. If your die rolls fall short, you can also use Tao tokens that match the color in addition to your roll. You may choose to use these after your roll. Taoists gain these tokens by using certain village tiles or by exorcising certain ghosts. One of the Taoists has a power that allows him to receive such a token once per turn.To win, the players must defeat the incarnation of Wu-Feng, a boss who arrives at the end of the game. There are also harder difficulty levels that add more incarnations of Wu-Feng, in which to win, you must defeat all of them.There are many more ways to lose, however. The players lose if three of the village's tiles are haunted, if the draw pile is emptied while the incarnation of Wu-Feng is still in play, or if all the priests are dead.</description>

<description>Conquest Tactics is a strategy card game with a fantasy theme. Players lead their armies across a battlefield to clash with their opponent, employing hand management, resource allocation and battlefield strategy to outwit each other. Players deploy troop cards to a grid battlefield and pay tactical points to move, attack and cast spells. Skills and Spells are taught to a player's entire army and reused each turn. Each player chooses from a selection of victory conditions and must achieve three victory conditions to win the match.The first chapter of Conquest Tactics features three army factions, but troops from different factions may be combined into one deck. The initial factions are:Humans: A balanced faction with a wide variety of Spells and SkillsKaborha: A powerhouse faction with strong, expensive troops and an emphasis on melee skillsThe Malice: A swarming faction with overwhelming numbers and a penchant for dark magicFor five hundred years, human civilization languished under the rule of the Kaborha, a society focused solely on honor, battle, and a tri-annual tournament for supremacy. Now a young hero has emerged, bringing hope of returning humanity to its former glory. But even as Humans rise up against their oppressors, a new threat has come to their world. The Malice -an interdimensional army of evil creatures- has descended upon the homeland of the Kaborha and Humans, lurching the Fire Continent out of a centuries long stagnation and into war! Traditional ways will be broken and unlikely alliances formed to repel the oncoming evil. Only you have the power to determine the future of the Fire Continent and the world of Yen-Sen.The time has come for you to lead your chosen forces into battle in Conquest Tactics, a new strategy card game. Choose your Victory Conditions and your Base, assemble your Troops and march them across the battlefield. Teach them Spells and Skills to use again and again, and empower them with Equipment. Bend fate in your favor with Circumstance cards, and claim powerful relics as your Trophies. Vanquish your enemies by using real strategy, movement and range to your advantage. Never before has a collectible card game given you this much control and this level of strategic choice.Rather than pursue a single goal, Conquest Tactics has several different Victory Conditions that can be achieved in order to win. You might choose to invade and occupy your opponent’s side of the field, destroy their base, challenge troops that are stronger than your own, or upgrade a troop to it’s highest potential. As a reward for achieving a Victory Condition, you are bestowed a Trophy which grants a special onetime benefit, such as the ability to draw extra cards, deal additional damage or search for the perfect troop you need at the moment.Each army in Conquest Tactics has its own types of troops. Unique to the world of Conquest Tactics are the Kaborha, a strong and proud race matching the cunning of humans with raw animalistic power. Troop cards have deployment, movement, and attack costs. The troop card also lists the damage done by the troop in an attack and the ability of the troop to defend itself. Finally, each troop card details the health of the troop and any special abilities that unit may have. Some troops have the ability to cast magic or use special skills.When your Troops can't get by on courage alone, give them Equipment to better their chances of survival. Equipment comes in three varieties: Armor, Weapons and Accessories. These improvements attach directly to a Troop, making it more powerful in the midst of battle. Troops may also use spells and skills on the battlefield. Spell cards consist of fire, light and dark magic that may be used to heal, harm, cripple and defend in battle. However, only troops that are able to cast a particular type of magic are able to use that magic's spells. These abilities are put into your Knowledge Pool where they may be used repeatedly throughout the game by your various troops, but they have a cost each time they are used and may only be used once per turn.Each deck has one base which serves as a stronghold and is one of the principal sources of a player's power. Bases give their armies additional strengths such as the ability to upgrade troops faster or replace fallen troops. However, Bases are not without their weakness as they may be destroyed, removing the benefits granted by it.Circumstance cards may be played at any time and do not need to be cast by a troop with the ability to use magic. These cards may enable you to increase your tactical points, negate an attack or even reflect an attack back at a troop when your opponent least expects it! Circumstance cards are paid for using the cards in your hand. If you don't have enough cards to discard from your hand you can't use your circumstance cards, thus hand management is another essential skill in Conquest Tactics.</description>

<description>Drako is an asymmetrical game for two players, with one player leading a team of three dwarves who are experienced dragon hunters and the other playing a red dragon that has spread terror amongst local peasants. The dwarves have managed to trap the dragon in a shady valley at the foot of the mountain where it lives – apparently dragons can't resist the smell of freshly slaughtered sheep – but despite being in chains, the dragon is still young and ferocious, providing the dwarves with the difficult task of killing it without being killed themselves.Each player has a unique deck of cards, and each card has symbols on it to indicate possible actions. The dragon can move around the game board, bite, shoot fire, fly (in a limited way), and defend itself from attacks; the dwarves can attack with their axes, shoot crossbows, move individually or in groups, protect themselves with shields, and cast nets.Each player can have up to six cards in hand, and managing these cards and maneuvering their characters on the game board are the keys to victory. Has the opponent run out of defense cards? Can the dragon nip the strongest dwarf and take him out without opening himself up to attacks from the others? The dwarves can attack the dragon's wings to keep it from flying, chop its legs so it can't move, and cut its throat to prevent it from breathing fire.If the dwarves kill the dragon before it breaks from the trap – that is before dwarves run out of cards – they win. If the dragon survives or defeats the dwarves, he will manage to free his trapped leg and fly away, triumphing over his opponents. </description>

<description>Pixel Tactics 2 is a head-to-head game of tactical combat for two players. Each player has an identical deck of 25 cards, from which they draft a leader. The leader's abilities alter vastly the strategy and playability of every other card in the deck, making the game playable in 25 different ways.In the game, players take turns placing cards and attacking. Each card can activate in various ways, taking on offensive capabilities in the front rows of the unit, or support powers in the back rows. Cards can also be played as orders – powerful single-time effects that can turn the tide of battle.Play continues until either player's leader is defeated. A typical game is best of three or five rounds.Pixel Tactics 2 takes place in the same world and uses many of the characters from Level 99 Games' BattleCON: War of Indines, but its gameplay is entirely unrelated. </description>

<description>"The cost of victory is blood, the cost of defeat is everything." –The Empire at WarSet amid the constant warfare of the Old World, Warhammer: Diskwars is a game of ferocious, fast-paced tabletop battles for two to four players. At the heart of the game's conflicts are its disks, which represent heroes and units from across the Old World. During the game, you activate these disks, flipping them end over end to move them across the battlefield, position them to attack, and interact with terrain and other disks it overlaps. When one disk covers another disk, the disk on top is considered to be "pinning" the disk below it; this prevents the pinned disk from activating, and at the end of the round, overlapping disks must fight one another. By maneuvering carefully to pin your opponent's units, you can strike them down, seize control of the battlefield, and win the day!Warhammer: Diskwars has been updated to its new setting within the Warhammer world and features flexible rules for hero-centric army-building. Additionally, whereas the original Diskwars was a collectible game, Warhammer: Diskwars has moved away from the blind buy model, and the Core Set includes everything you need to play the game: a host of terrain cards, objectives, command cards, and more than sixty disks for the game's four races.</description>

<description>In Vikings: Warriors of the North, players take the roles of Viking jarls, fighting for control over the North and the Konung Crown. The first one to pillage all of the villages and take the daughters of their thanes to his home port as warranty of recognition of jarls authority will be declared the winner. To do this, the jarls will have to brave the stormy northern seas, battling each other along the way, and watch out for the sea monster that lurks beneath the waves! The most cunning and vehement of them all – that is, the one who the Gods favor – will throw a great feast and become the Konung of the North.Vikings: Warriors of the North is a card-based game. Players draw cards from a common deck. Wind cards are used for moving a drakkar around the board that depicts the cold north sea. Players can move the drakkar to a village (to sack it), to an enemy drakkar (to attack it), or to their own ports, where they can throw a feast for the Gods.A player can also use cards to drastically change the gameplay: He can increase his chances in an attack, re-roll the dice, sail further with his drakkar, or steal cards from an enemy's hand. All of those cards represent story events that have tangible effects within the game. Some cards represent heroes who can become part of a drakkar's crew. As long as a hero stays on the ship, he grants his owner a permanent effect. Each drakkar has three open slots for heroes. Daughters of the thanes are also considered heroes, so they also occupy drakkar slots. With only three slots, players have to think hard about their crew composition.On a turn, a player can play any number of cards from his hand and take one action: attack, sack a village, throw a feast, etc. Attacks are resolved by a roll of a six-sided (d6) die, although many cards influence the combat result, so each battle is exciting.When a player take three daughters of the thanes (each of a different, opposing player color) and brings them to his own port, the game is over and that player wins. The gameplay is fast, furious and fun, full of twists and comebacks; it really lets you feel like a Viking chieftain!</description>

<description>Strongholdis a two-player game telling the story of a siege. Players take opposing sides: one has to defend the stronghold, and the other has to break into the castle as soon as possible. The game board represents the stronghold itself as well as the surrounding terrain, where enemy forces are placed and whence they proceed to the walls.The defender has a small number of soldiers manning the walls, while the invader has an infinite legion of attacking creatures. A desperate fight takes place every single turn. The invaders build war machines, equip their soldiers, train them, and use black magic rituals to achieve victory. Meanwhile, defenders repair walls, build cannons, train soldiers, and do everything they can to hold the castle as long as possible.If the invader manages to break into the castle before the end of seven rounds, they win; otherwise the defender wins.This second edition ofStrongholdfeatures:• Ten objective cards for the invader and ten hidden defense plan cards for the defender; each objective encourages the invader to consider a particular move, while each defense plan shows the defender different ways to surprise the invader• Shorter gameplay than the first edition, with attackers being placed on the board during set-up• Gameplay limited to two players only, replacing the team rules in the first edition• Streamlined rules and an enhanced rulebook• Improved components, such as a larger game board and new, drab, brown artwork</description>

<description>Summoner Wars is a fast-playing, action-packed card game for 2-4 players in which they take on the role of Summoners: powerful beings who harness the power of mysterious Summoning Stones to lead their race to conquest on the war-torn planet of Itharia. These Summoners wield terrible magic on the battlefield, freezing their foes in place, draining their enemies of power, and even bringing rains of fire down from the heavens. But most notoriously, they summon their great race's hordes of warriors to the battlefield, to clash in the never-ending struggle for supremacy. A Summoner is both mage and general, and must combine their wizardly might with clever tactics to defeat the enemy Summoner on the opposite side of the battle.The Summoner Wars Master Set contains six new and different complete factions from which to choose:• Play as the Shadow Elves and conceal your plans in swirling darkness!• Choose the Benders and confound your foe, turning his own troops against him!• Command the Vargath, mountainous goatfolk who call lightning from the heavens!• Select the nefarious Sand Goblins and delight in malicious trickery!• Muster the Deep Dwarves and control the forces of Geomancy!• Lead the ferocious Swamp Orcs to war and hack upon your foes as they are snared in your vines!Strategy shapes the composition of each deck of cards and how they are used. Tactics determine the effectiveness of those cards in battle. Call walls of stone to protect you in combat and serve as magic portals for you to summon your warriors. Call your forces forth and send them in a surging wave against your enemy. Cast spells that bolster your forces and cut down those who would oppose you.Victory can come only from the death of your opponent's Summoner...</description>

<description>Haven Town is facing total annihilation at the hands (and teeth) of a horde of monsters from beyond the Shadowrift.You the heroes must band together to drive them back. To do this, you will need powerful spells, skills, attacks and loot. When the game begins, you are a basic hero; you can explore and fight. Lucky for you, this is a deckbuilding game! You can buy new cards to add to your deck - cards which will define you as an adventurer and complement the strengths of your fellow heroes.Unlike other deckbuilders, there is constant interaction with your fellow players, as you figure out who will gain which benefit from the limited supply of townsfolk, offer your coin to help construct walls, and seek healing from anyone who's learned such magic.Shadowrift also features monsters that do not merely sit in play waiting to be slain - If you leave them alone they will rip Haven Town asunder. They'll kill people, break walls, and kick your heroes in the face. Combat with them is intuitive (though frequently painful).For defeating a monster, heroes gain Heroism, a simple, consistent boost to their power that makes them better at anything they undertake. Since the monsters won't stop coming until the last Shadowrift is sealed or the town has been built into a mighty fortress, you'll need every boost you can take.</description>

<description>Yomi is a card game that simulates a fighting game. It tests your ability to predict how your opponents will act and your ability to judge the relative value of cards from one situation to the next. Also, it lets you do fun combos and be a panda. There are 10 characters to choose from, each with their own deck, abilities, and style. Each deck also doubles as a regular deck of playing cards with beautiful artwork (the complete game features a whopping 120 different character illustrations).Yomi is the Japanese word for “reading”, in this case as in reading the mind of your opponent. Yomi: Fighting Card Game is a simple competitive card game that simulates a fight between two characters. Each deck in Yomi represents one character, with 10 decks in the first release.Champion fighting game tournament player and tournament organizer David Sirlin designed the game to test the skills of Valuation and Yomi. Valuation refers to your ability to judge the relative value of moves (or cards) as they change over the course of the game. Yomi, the game's title, refers to your ability to guess which moves your opponent will make. There is more to it than guessing, though: some players have the uncanny ability to “guess” right almost every time, no matter the game.The core mechanic is a paper-rock-scissors guessing game between attack, throw, and block/dodge (sometimes modified by special ability cards). Attacks and throws usually let you follow up with combo cards from your hand, while blocks let you draw a card. While it first seems "just random," you soon discover that the unequal and uncertain payoffs in this guessing game allow you really read what the opponent will do. Yomi captures the kind of mind games that occur during the high level in fighting game tournaments.X</description>

<description>Puzzle Strike is a card game played with cardboard chips instead of cards that simulates a puzzle video game such as Puzzle Fighter or Tetris.It's a deckbuilding game, which means you build your deck *as* you play the game. Every game is different because the bank starts with a different set of chips each time. Also, there are 10 characters to choose from in the base set, each with different gameplay. Between all that, there are over 411 MILLION starting conditions in a 4-player game, and even more if you include the expansion.A built-in comeback mechanic means that when you're on the edge of losing, you're also able to do even more combos than usual.You don't have to worry about shuffling cards because you just put your cardboard tokens in a bag and shake them up to shuffle! Plus, it’s pretty ballin’ to play a game with chips. Play it on your yacht, impress potential mates, etc.Though the game is fun even if you're terrible at it, it's also balanced for high level play by veteran asymmetric game balancer David Sirlin (Street Fighter HD Remix, Puzzle Fighter HD Remix, Kongai, Yomi, and Flash Duel.)This 3rd Edition of the game has many changes including:Panic Time to prevent games from going too longA 3-player and 4-player mode with no player elimination and that allows crashing your gems to whoever you wantA 2v2 Team Battle ModeA Custom Clockwork mode to draft your own characterPuzzle chips and character chips updated to ensure healthy competitive play in tournamentsNew components: game boards and privacy screens</description>

<description>Kings of Artifice is a strategy board game for 2 to 4 players. The game is played in a series of building rounds, followed by one final crowning round. Victory Points (VP) are awarded for building structures during the game as well as at the end. In each game, two special scoring cards are drawn from a deck that allow players to gain bonus points by meeting certain conditions.In the building rounds, the players summon their specialized characters onto the game board and employ them (using Action Points) to construct valuable structures such as Walls, Houses, Battlements, Towers, Palaces, Fountains, and Pastures. These are built from their supplies of colored building blocks. In addition to expanding their own kingdoms, the players can use their forces to hinder the progress of their rivals.In the crowning round, the players display their completed kingdoms and flaunt their power over the realm. The player with the most Victory Points at the end of the game is the winner!Character Classes:Kings summon the other characters to the board from the supply.Villagers are needed to build Houses (which can be converted into Towers and Palaces).Artisans are necessary to complete the building of advanced structures.Horses assist the other characters in their movements on the board.Thieves can climb on Walls, and can steal Action Points from their rivals.Knights can attack opponents' characters. Warlocks can use their Mana to cast spells (which are different in each game).</description>

<description>Oddly enough, several of you have been hired to build the city of OddVille, home to four powerful worker guilds.Cleverly place your buildings in order to obtain greater power and fame, while thwarting your opponents' plans. Manage your workers to obtain the resources, coins, and building projects you need in order to make your mark on the city. Plan the city streets to get access to resources or coins from nearby buildings, even if not yours.Impress the right guild, and you will get a visit from a guild member, who will gladly help you out while enjoying your hospitality. The guild comes first, though: At a moment's notice, every guild member will return to the guild hall, regardless of how much that inconveniences you. Of course, the person who "inspired" the guild meeting may be chuckling gleefully at the "unfortunate" timing of your guest's departure.OddVille is a card-based city-building game in which all actions are carried out by playing one of your four Worker cards. Each Worker card has a different power and can be used in different ways: to get a project, to obtain resources, or to collect coins. During your turn, you can either play a card or add a building to the city. Connect it to adjacent buildings with roads and you will gain their bonus.The city grows with each player's contribution, ever changing the values of players' buildings. As soon as a player builds his sixth building, the game ends and the player with the most points wins.</description>

<description>In War of the Ring, one player takes control of the Free Peoples (FP), the other player controls Shadow Armies (SA).Initially, the Free People Nations are reluctant to take arms against Sauron, so they must be attacked by Sauron or persuaded by Gandalf or other Companions, before they start to fight properly: this is represented by the Political Track, which shows if a Nation is ready to fight in the War of the Ring or not.The game can be won by a military victory, if Sauron conquers a certain number of Free People cities and strongholds or vice versa. But the true hope of the Free Peoples lies with the quest of the Ringbearer: while the armies clash across Middle Earth, the Fellowship of the Ring is trying to get secretly to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. Sauron is not aware of the real intention of his enemies but is looking across Middle Earth for the precious Ring, so that the Fellowship is going to face numerous dangers, represented by the rules of The Hunt for the Ring. But the Companions can spur the Free Peoples to the fight against Sauron, so the Free People player must balance the need to protect the Ringbearer from harm, against the attempt to raise a proper defense against the armies of the Shadow, so that they do not overrun Middle Earth before the Ringbearer completes his quest.Each game turn revolves around the roll of Action Dice: each die corresponds to an action that a player can do during a turn. Depending on the face rolled on each die, different actions are possible (moving armies, characters, recruiting troops, advancing a Political Track).Action dice can also be used to draw or play Event Cards. Event Cards are played to represent specific events from the story (or events which could possibly have happened) which cannot be portrayed through normal game-play. Each Event Card can also create an unexpected turn in the game, allowing special actions or altering the course of a battle.Re-implements:War of the Ring (first edition)</description>

<description>In Mice and Mystics players take on the roles of those still loyal to the king – but to escape the clutches of Vanestra, they have been turned into mice! Play as cunning field mice who must race through a castle now twenty times larger than before. The castle would be a dangerous place with Vanestra's minions in control, but now countless other terrors also await heroes who are but the size of figs. Play as nimble Prince Collin and fence your way past your foes, or try Nez Bellows, the burly smith. Confound your foes as the wizened old mouse Maginos, or protect your companions as Tilda, the castle's former healer. Every player will have a vital role in the quest to warn the king, and it will take careful planning to find Vanestra's weakness and defeat her.Mice and Mystics is a cooperative adventure game in which the players work together to save an imperiled kingdom. They will face countless adversaries such as rats, cockroaches, and spiders, and of course the greatest of all horrors: the castle's housecat, Brodie. Mice and Mystics is a boldly innovative game that thrusts players into an ever-changing, interactive environment, and features a rich storyline that the players help create as they play the game. The Cheese System allows players to hoard the crumbs of precious cheese they find on their journey, and use it to bolster their mice with grandiose new abilities and overcome seemingly insurmountable odds.Mice and Mystics will provide any group of friends with an unforgettable adventure they will be talking about for years to come – assuming they can all squeak by...</description>

<description>Note: This game is in German, but the game itself is language independent.  English rules can be foundhere.Elfenland is a redesign of the original White Wind game Elfenroads. The game is set in the mythical world of the elves. A group of fledgling elves (the players) are charged with visiting as many of the twenty Elfencities as they can over the course of 4 rounds. To accomplish the task they will use various forms of transportation such as Giant Pigs, Elfcarts, Unicorns, Rafts, Magic Clouds, Trollwagons, and Dragons.Gameplay: Players begin in the Elf capitol, draw one face down movement tile, and are dealt eight transport cards and a secret 'home' city card that they must reach at the end of the 4th round or lose points for each city space away from 'home' they are at the end of the game. Markers of each player's color are placed in each city on the board and are collected when the player visits that city (each counts as 1 point).The round proceeds in 2 stages. The first part of the round consists of the drawing of Tiles showing the differing types of transport (except rafts) from a combination of face up and face down tiles (if a player doesn't like the 5 tiles that are face up; they can always draw blind from the face down tiles and hope to get one they need). These transport tiles need to match the Transportation cards in your hand to use them most effectively. After each player has a total of 4 tiles they take it in turns placing a tile on any one of the roads that run between the elf cities. Only one transport tile may be placed on each road; so players may use other players tiles to travel if they have the matching cards in their hand. This frequently causes a readjustment of planned travel routes as other players tiles can allow you to move farther or shorter than you had first thought. Players can play their tiles to help themselves or hinder others by playing a slow mode of transport on another players (perceived) path.Each mode of transport has certain terrain it can travel through quickly or slowly, and those that it cannot. These are listed on the top of each transportation card by the number terrain symbols. The number of terrain symbols equals how many matching cards you must play to move across a given tile in a given terrain. For example, a Magic Cloud tile placed in a mountain would take one Magic cloud card to travel across (1 mountain symbol on card means Magic clouds are fast in mountains). If the same tile was placed on a road in forest terrain it would require 2 Magic Cloud cards to travel that route (2 Forest symbols on card means Magic Clouds are slow in Forest). Magic Clouds cannot travel in desert terrain at all (no desert symbols on card). All modes of transport are different and Rafts can be used on rivers or lakes without needing tiles they go slow upstream 2 raft cards needed and fast downstream 1 card needed. The small lake requires 1 raft card to travel across and the larger lake requires 2 cards to travel across. Players may keep one unused transport counter and up to 4 Transportation cards from one round to the next.The second part of the round begins after all players have finished placing their transportation tiles for the round. Each player plays his cards and moves his elf-boot around the board collecting his tokens from the cities visited. If there is a Transport tile on a route and a player has no matching Transportation card he may 'Caravan' across it by playing any 3 Transportation cards from his hand.As a bit of 'take that' each player has a trouble tile which can be placed next to any transportation tile during the first part of the round. This counter means that in order to travel that path an additional card of the transport type must be played or 4 cards to 'Caravan'.Victory: if at the end of round 3 a player has visited all 20 cities he is the winner. If not the game ends after round 4 when 'Home' cities are revealed and each player subtracts points for each city he is away from his 'home' subtracting that from his collected city tokens. The person with the highest score wins.</description>

<description>This description's a bit tricky, so let's take it in stages...Countermay: The Tapestry of Worlds, the crossroads of civilizations beyond imagining. After a thousand years of war, Countermay is dying. Battles, curses, extraterrestrial parasites, demonic influence, and other hazards have ruined much of the planet. The food is running out, and the threat of starvation looms. The only way to save Countermay is to seize undisputed control. Until then, armies march, fed with the ever-dwindling food as they churn farmland into mud with their boots. Can you save Countermay from its invitable doom?Romance of the Nine Empires is a fictitious interactive collectible card game (CCG) set in the fantasy world of Countermay. In the game, players assume command of one of nine vastly different warring factions — including steampunk aliens, a dark god-king's crusade of conversion, displaced WWII-era American GIs, and a risen empire of the undead — to expand, glorify, or defend their empires. Through its fictitious fifteen-year history, players have shaped the world of Countermay through their individual and collective achievements, and the results are reflected in the story and the current state of the empires.Romance of the Nine Empires is based on the Legend of the Five Rings CCG and was created for use in the movie The Gamers: Hands of Fate, mimicking the way that L5R tournament results affect the actual story in future expansions of that CCG but allowing the movie creators more freedom to design the game to match the characters in the movie. L5R publisher AEG agreed to be the in-movie publisher of the fictional Romance of the Nine Empires, but as a result of Kickstarter funding for The Gamers: Hands of Fate, it decided to create a real-life version of R9E.This game represents the 15th Anniversary World Championship Edition of Romance of the Nine Empires, and (to slip into the movie storyline for a second) it holds the decks used by the top-placing players for each faction that made it to the quarterfinals at the 2012 World Championships at Gen Con Indy.</description>

<description>In Bridge Troll, you and your friends are hideous trolls who each guard a troll bridge. Each turn, you throw boulders to bid for travelers, who vary in number depending on the weather for that day. Travelers include fat merchants, pilgrims, poor monks (who make good eating), and if you are lucky, royal personages. As travelers come to your bridge, you use them to collect tolls. But watch out! Knights, bandits, dragons, and vicious Billy Goats Gruff prowl the countryside. You'll have to use some of your boulders to chase them away (which means you’ll have fewer left to use on your bridge!).Although you need to collect tolls from travelers so you can buy building supplies, working on your bridge makes you hungry, so you will have to eat some of your travelers instead. It is important to balance tolls with food in order to make your bridge very appealing to travelers. If you eat too many travelers or just collect money, you won't be able to fix up your bridge. The player who uses toll-money, food, and boulders to build the most impressive troll bridge operation wins the game.</description>

<description>...and then we held hands.is a co-operative game about finding balance. To win, the two players must complete objectives and reach the center of the board.The players take turns trying to fulfill the current common emotional objective by discarding emotion cards to move from node to node. They must do this without verbal communication, empathizing and always considering each other's situation when making a move.A player can use their own cards or their partner's, but if their move causes their partner to be unable to move, the players lose and the game ends. While moving from node to node, their balance shifts, and they are not able to refill their hand.The game features a card-splaying mechanism in which players change their "perspective" to reveal a new set of options.The players win by meeting in the center while in a balanced state and within one turn of each other - something quite difficult, and therefore very rewarding when achieved....and then we held hands. features art by beloved French illustrator Marie Cardouat, known for the art found in beautiful games such as Dixit, Steam Park, and Marrakech.</description>

<description>'Tis the dawn of the 19th century; an age of science, superstition, and witchcraft. Howling fills the night as a full moon rises over the small, secluded village of Shadowbrook. Gruesome murders have become a daily occurrence and terror haunts the streets at night.

<description>You are not breach mages yet,” Brama lectures as she paces down the line of students, her frail form belying her immense power. “Breach mages have protected us since the beginning — since the burning of the world and our pilgrimage into the dark. It was they who founded Gravehold, our last bastion, and if you wish to stand beside these living legends, you must listen and learn. The Nameless shall come again, as they always have, and you will need to be ready. You are the hope of our future.”</description>

<description>A STORYTELLING BOARD GAME SET IN THE 1970s COLD WAR ERA.SMERSHis a portmanteau of two Russian words that translates to "Death to Spies." It operated as a counter-intelligence agency by the Red Army during the 1940s. Despite having had a large number of paid employees, little was known about the agency until recently when Russia opened their archives.Agents of SMERSHis a cooperative Storytelling game that pits players as UN Secret Service Spies set in an alternate 1970s timeline against a newly formed and independent SMERSH. The game will be able to accommodate play with either The Encounter Book that contains over 1500 written encounters with a similar reaction matrix toTales of the Arabian Nights- or played more simply with only encounter cards with shorter encounters and no matrix. Agents of SMERSH includes custom dice to determine success or failure of encounters, and more strategic play from what is typically expected of a Storytelling board game. There are plenty of James Bond gadgets, guns, cars, pop references and detailed artwork - not to mention a touch of humor. The game features the artwork of George Patsouras (The Resistance&amp;amp;Flash Point).</description>

<description>It is all going so well for you in Tahiti - sun and surf are yours to enjoy. The Director has not troubled you with silly assignments, such as escorting ill-mannered diplomats to parties; nor have you had to drop off intelligence in trash bins to be picked up by shady, desperate officials. You've made time to rest and do little other than drink martinis... Maybe you should hang up your hat and let someone else handle Dr. Lobo?Alas, good things never last..."Agent, you're going to Australia," the Director informs you. "As you are well aware, Australia has descended into corruption and chaos these past several years. You won't have time for barbies on the beach."InAgents of SMERSH: Swagman's Hope, players have five new city locations to visit and a new book, featuring more than 300 encounters, with its own Reaction Sheet. Australia is the most dangerous country in the world, so why would important persons of intellect and power be trapped there? It is up to the players to come to their aid before SMERSH gets to them. Not only must players gain the normal Yellow Intel during the course of the game, but there are new Red Intel, representing scientists and researchers with vital knowledge for which Dr Lobo is hungry. Hurry to their aid before they get abducted and taken into the lawless Swagman's Hope where they may disappear forever. Swagman's Hope is a godforsaken, desert town in the middle of the Australian Outback - a dirty haven for the criminally insane and insanely criminal.Also included inAgents of SMERSH: Swagman's Hopeare new Villain, Fate and Status Cards, a new HENCHMAN, the Stranded Deck, Red Intel and Dead Drop Tokens, and 2 new UN agents to join in the hunt. Despite the town's name, hope is in short supply. Best of luck to you, Agent.</description>

<description>Alchemy!is a card game that turns 2-5 players into competing apprentice alchemists trying to impress their master by being the first to complete a set of potions in a laboratory space they all share. Every turn, players can rush to finish their work or sabotage those who are pursuing the same potions they are, and once you've completed a potion, you can keep it for victory points or drink it to try to get even further ahead.Every turn, players draw cards and 'transmute' a component from a pool they share with all of the other players at the table in order to produce 'elements' (earth, air, fire, water) that can then be combined to try to match the formulas at the bottom of the potion cards that act as victory points.Potions are randomized each game, so each match has its own feel - some are very directly competitive, producing potions that allow players to directly attack one another, and others require more indirection and planning. Analyzing the available potions and trying to predict the interplay between them and the value of victory points vs. the effects of the potions is a key element of play.</description>

<description>Tensions have been high with the alien "bug" races of the galaxy – the Zothren – and your ship has crash landed on the planet Hive IV, one of the more renegade "bug" planets. You quickly set up perimeter force fields and begin surveying the surrounding terrain for debris from your ship, only to find it scattered everywhere. Then you see them – at first only a few "bug" scouts, but then the numbers begin to increase all around you: archers, slashers, and even the monstrous brutes. This is more than a scouting party; this is a war party! They begin to attack the shields as the crew starts to retrieve debris. The SOS has been sent and a ship in the sector has responded, but can it get to you before the "bugs" overwhelm your crew? Can you repair parts of the ship and use it as a defense? Can you repair the hull and fire up the engine to lift off? It's all in the hands of the crew – your hands.InAlien Uprising, the player crew must either hold off the Zothren attacks until the rescue ship arrives, or repair the ship and lift off from the hostile planet before being destroyed. To achieve either of these goals, the crew must work together, using their unique skills and chosen actions to perform a number of tasks, defend themselves, and retrieve and repair equipment and the ship.To establish the actions available each turn, the first player rolls custom dice, then each player chooses an action for the turn, starting with the first player. The available actions include combat, engineering, reload/recharge first aid, scout, and wild; the dice also have an alien icon that shows the speed of the enemy while limiting the actions that players have available to them. Players also have unique character skills, and the game can be set to higher levels of difficulty for more experienced players.</description>

<description>In a distant time – so far in the future that either global warming or technical progress is so advanced that windmills are going swimmingly in the antarctic climate – the rising sea level and increased resource consumption has driven mankind to increase investment in polar research. The Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research sees an increasingly creative interpretation of the Antarctic Treaty System.Your objective inAntarcticais to develop research centers in Antarctica and to mine resources – for research purposes only, of course. The sun orbits Antarctica counter-clockwise, and each ship it thaws moves on for scientific progress. At the end of the game, victory points for all kinds of majorities are granted. Will your consort be the one that gained a fortune ... er, has done most to rescue mankind?Turn order is determined by the sun. Whenever it shines on one of your ships, you may erect buildings, recruit new scientists, build more ships, or do scientific research. The game ends when all buildings have been erected, or when one player has placed his last scientist.</description>

<description>Note: Mini expansion included in the gameAs the legend goes, Jason was a prince of Iolkos. His father Aeson, the king, was dethroned by Pelias, the king’s brother. The usurper Pelias gave Aeson his word that when Jason will come of age, he will give crown and throne to the young prince, but that was a promise he did not intend to keep. When Jason, a young man now, confronted Pelias and asked him to honor his word, the usurper tasked Jason with a seemingly impossible quest to prove that he is worthy of the throne of Iolkos. He had to recover the Golden Fleece from the distant city of Kolchis. Jason accepted and sent word to famous heroes to aid him in his quest. Hercules, Orpheus, the brothers Kastor and Polydefkis, Laertes the father of Ulysses, were some of the 50 heroes who answered Jason’s call and joined him in his noble quest on board the legendary ship “Argo”.Argonautsis a cooperative game that requires careful strategic planning and just a bit of luck, as even the best laid plans, can fall victim to the wrath of the Gods. The game’s objectives are to acquire the Golden Fleece and return safely to Iolkos without losing Argo or too many members of her crew. Each player controls heroes that participated in the Argonaut campaign, each with his / her own set of skills and special abilities. Following the journey from the myth, the Argonauts must face mythical monsters like Scylla and Harybdis, Harpies, Sirens, the construct Talos and the dragon guarding the Fleece, not to mention the perilous journey full of lethal encounters with merciless pirates or having to weather destructive thunderstorms all the while making sure their cargo hold is well stocked with the necessary supplies for the journey to and from Kolchis and their ship sea-worthy.Each turn, the players must decide which of their characters will participate in the encounter they face, dealing with threats with either might or cunning and keeping in mind that these characters will be unavailable to face the next encounter due to exhaustion. But the Argonauts are not alone in their quest. The Gods occasionally take interest in their actions, either helping or hindering the progress of our heroes, laying careful plans to waste…</description>

<description>The Encampmentrules introduce Spawning Points that may move back and forth from Zone 3 to Zone 2 depending on the Summoning rolls, creating a more dynamic pattern of invasion.When setting up the game with the Encampment Tiles, players will place Spawning Tokens on the board in the indicated spots - these represent the moving enemy Encampments. When a Square symbol is rolled on the Summoning Roll, the Spawning Point will spawn the enemies listed on the corresponding Enemy card and then the Spawning Token is moved forward to Zone 2. A Triangle result will make the Spawning Point continue where it's at, and a Circle result will move the Spawning Point back to Zone 3.This mobile nature of theEncampment Tile Setbrings a new and fresh experience when defending the Citadel! With enemies appearing on Zones 2 and 3, the pressure builds up on the Heroes! Assault units will be one step closer and the Catapult won't be as strong when the Spawning Points are on Zone 2's, but on the other hand, Heavy Units that Spawn on Zone 2 will have to move to Zone 3 before they start firing upon the Citadel, which will buy the Heroes and the Citadel some time! The symbols to the left of the Encampment Tiles indicate the behaviour of the different enemy types, depending on where they are spawned.The Encampment Tile Setcan be played with anyB-Siegedenemy army, whether it be the Abyssal Forces from Sons of the Abyss or the Iron Orc nation from the Darkness &amp;amp; Fury expansion!</description>

<description>A dark rift has opened, spewing monsters of the Abyss to lay siege to the Citadel of Modhelm! All hope lies on the mighty heroes who unite to defend its walls.B-Sieged: Sons of the Abyssis a fully cooperative castle defense board game that combines exciting combat action with classic resource management. In this thrilling battle, 1 to 6 players control the mighty Heroes of Modhelm, who must endure the siege of the encroaching enemies and hold out long enough for the Messenger to return with a powerful magic artifact that will break the enemy forces.During their turn, Heroes may take 3 actions. They can spend these actions to visit the various buildings inside the Citadel to get resources (such as Food, Gold, Special Abilities, and Cards), repair damaged buildings, trade cards, fight Enemies from the walls, or try to use the powerful catapult at the center of the Citadel. The Heroes must coordinate their actions well to share resources, gather vital supplies, and survive the siege.After the Heroes have acted, it’s the Monsters' turn. Each monster figure on the board will activate and perform their actions according to its rank. For 12 rounds that encompass the 4 seasons, the heroes must fight to keep the citadel safe. If the messenger can return in time with the magic artifact, the abyssal forces will be cast back into the fiery darkness.To make matters worse, a surprise disruption may summon the Avatar of the Abyss itself! This behemoth marches inexorably towards the citadel. Stop it in time, or it’ll shatter the defenses, and destroy the citadel!</description>

<description> Betrayal Legacy marries the concept of Betrayal at House on the Hill — exploring a haunted mansion — with the permanency and multi-game storytelling exhibited by Daviau's Risk Legacy and other legacy games that followed. Betrayal Legacy consists of a prologue and a thirteen-chapter story that takes place over decades. Players represent families, with specific members of a family participating in one story, then perhaps an older version of those characters (assuming they lived) or their descendants showing up in later stories.Why would people keep exploring a haunted mansion for decade after decade, especially when horrible things happen there? Curiosity, I suppose, or perhaps an ignorant boldness that comes from the belief that we know better than those who have come before. Look at all that we've learned, marvel at the tools we have at hand! Surely we'll all exit safely this time...As with other Betrayal titles, the game is narratively-driven, with elements that record the history of your specific games. The tools mentioned earlier, for example, become attached to specific families. This isn't just a bucket; it's my bucket, the one my grandpappy used to feed his family's pigs when he was a boy, and while you can certainly use that bucket, I know how to wield it best from the time he spent teaching me how to slop. Yes, it's an heirloom bucket, and when kept in the family, I get a bonus for using it.</description>

<description>As Hitler's grasp on Germany tightens and his maniacal fervor is unmasked, men from the highest levels of the Reich begin to plot his assassination. As the clock ticks and Hitler's ambitions grow, these daring few must build their strength and prepare for the perfect moment to strike. The Gestapo hound their trail, calling these conspirators "Schwarze Kapelle", the Black Orchestra. Will this band of daring patriots save their country from utter ruin before it is too late?Black Orchestrabegins with each player choosing an historic figure involved in the conspiracy against Hitler. In this dark and dangerous pursuit, motivation is perhaps your greatest weapon. If you can stay true to your convictions in the face of overwhelming threat and inspire your comrades, then you will be able to use your special ability, attempt plots, and even become zealous (necessary for some extremely daring plots).But every move you make may also increase the suspicion of the authorities. The Gestapo will make routine sweeps, and any players with high suspicion will be arrested and interrogated (possibly resulting in other players being arrested). If you are all arrested or if the Gestapo finds your secret papers, you lose. And the suspicion placed on each conspirator will increase the chances their plots are detected.On a turn, players may take three actions, such as moving, searching for an item, or drawing a card; or, at the cost of one action per die, roll the dice in an attempt to gain even more actions — at the risk of attracting the suspicion of the gestapo. This dice rolling "Conspire" action allows players to make bold moves when most needed.After the actions have been taken, an event card is drawn. The game is played over seven stages of World War 2, represented by seven stacks of event cards. These cards walk you through the events of WWII in a roughly (but not strictly) chronological order. New stages open up new areas of the board, cause Hitler and his deputies to interact with the Conspirators, and present various opportunities or threats. During the final stage, many board spaces become off-limits, as the Allies move closer to Germany.To win, players must collect a plot card and fulfill all necessary requirements listed (such as having Hitler be in a certain space and possessing certain items--detonator &amp;amp; fuse, etc.). The active player may then attempt the plot by rolling the indicated dice, including all additional modifiers and helpful Action cards. The total of number of "Target" symbols needed to kill Hitler is based on Hitler's military support, but a Conspirator's security level decides if any "Eagles" rolled will see them detected, and foil the plot regardless. Players must consider their ability to successfully complete a plot and the relative suspicion levels of the different Conspirators involved.Players will need to work together and agree on the wisest course of action, as well as have a little luck, to succeed. The phenomenon of one player dominating the game because of it's cooperative nature is mitigated by the fact that there are no certainties, and often a player will need to make a bold or reckless move to keep the conspiracy alive. Cool heads often prevail, but play it too cool and you may miss your chance. The co-operative dynamic gets really interesting if a player is ever arrested, and fails to resist interrogation, then they will need to make a big decision all by themselves, without revealing their options to the group. No one player can guarantee success. It is hoped that players will have tense conversations similar to those had by the real conspirators and enjoy a truly unique historical experience.</description>

<description>The sergeant hangs the phone up. "Multiple hostages, numerous bombs. We're up." We grab our gear, prep the robot and load the van. It's go time...An unknown terrorist organization is on the rise, looking to spread fear while profiting from the chaos they release. You, your fellow members of the Retro City Bomb Squad, and your trusty Bomb Squad Robot are the only barriers in the way between those dastardly villains and the innocent civilians of Retro City. Lives are at stake — and time is ticking — so let's go!Bomb Squadis a cooperative game in which 2-6 players are members of a team operating a disposal robot with the mission to disarm bombs and save hostages. The players work together, racing against the clock to provide the appropriate instructions for the robot to achieve their mission objectives.Bomb Squadfeatures:Real-time play:Players each take a turn in clockwise order and are free to take as long as they want on their turn. However, there is a timer counting down in real time until the bombs will detonate, so players will want to be as efficient as possible.Hidden Card Information:Players hold their cards so that the fronts are facing the other players, which requires that players give each other Intel to figure out which cards they have in hand.Limited Communication:While players have their cards up and visible to each other, players are allowed to communicate only via the Intel they give each other, which provides hints about the cards they have in their hands. Table talk about which cards are needed, or where the robot should go, gives implied hints about which cards to play and is prohibited.Co-operative game play:The players all work together, winning or losing collectively as a team.</description>

<description>In the year 3085, four teenage heroes-for-hire and their pals warp through the universe to save adorable aliens and their worlds. When evil gets all fancy, they break that biz down...for hope!In theBravest Warriors Co-operative Dice Game, you take on the role of one of the Bravest Warriors or one of their best pals. Working together, you'll try to overcome Events and Encounters seen inBravest Warriorsepisodes using your Portals and Special Abilities. Encounters require various symbols to beat them, and those symbols are found on the twelve custom dice, which are divided up between the players as evenly as possible. Each player rolls her own dice, but once rolled the dice are pooled together to use them as best you can as a team. If you don't roll what you need, you can play Portal cards (as seen in the "Sugarbellies" episode of the show) or use your character's Special Abilities. Conversion Portals, Re-Roll Portals, Gift Portals and more can make the difference between success and failure.When you fail a challenge, the team suffers a calamity and the Encounter is placed into the Failed! pile. If you fail five Encounters, you lose the game! If you run out of Portal cards, you lose the game! If too many Bravest Warriors get K.O.ed, you lose the game! But if you score enough Victory Points or use up all of the Event cards, your team wins! (The actual number of VPs needed to win depends on whether you're playing easy mode (for younger or new players) or standard mode.)</description>

<description>The ancient manuscripts talk about a Leviathan, a huge creature lying on the silt bed of the lagoon on whose back the city has its foundations. All manuscripts agree on its eternal sleep and they all tell that the beast will wake up one day, shaking the city from its muddy roots, smashing the vitrified stilts on which the city stands, and crashing it into the seething sea where the monster will rise. The ancients say, however, that there will be signs; it is written that the Venetians will feel the tremors, that they would therefore save themselves from the monster, who will recover his freedom by plunging into the waves a deserted city.But there were no signs. What ancients did not know is that the Leviathan is not alive. For centuries, the city lived and prospered on the back of a corpse. That corpse, though, is now awakening – and with it the dead arise from the lagoon...In the cooperative game Carnival Zombie, players lead a group of characters who are fleeing on terra firma from the terror that has emerged from the lagoon of Venice. This group of characters must make its way through hordes of rotting "Infected" to leave the city, and players need to rush as the Leviathan upon which the foundations of Venice were built is awakening. Thus, it's only a matter of time before the city sinks in the dark waters of the lagoon.Each game is divided into several nights and days. During the nights, players hide in trenches behind the barricades to resist the attacks of the Infected. During the day, players move through the city, which is shaken by tremors. The Infected are drawn by the groans of the Leviathan in the abyss to help their master free itself from the rotting stilts that nail it to the silt bed.Players have several ways to get out of town, but little time to do it – and their path is hindered by the bosses, the most implacable servants of the Leviathan. If the players do make it out, they can assess their skills – and set a goal for next time – by counting the points scored during the game.</description>

Of course, the denizens have special powers of their own to aid in the defense. Will you be able to survive these attacks?Castellionis a tile-laying game in which you form parts of the castle for defense against monsters. Each turn you flip over a tile and either use its special ability or place it as part of your castle. The more towers and keeps you form, the better your defense against attacks. Ranks prevent traitorous tiles from affecting you fully. When all three monsters have attacked and you still have a base of six tiles, you win.</description>

<description>CELESTIAL RAINBOWS is a light, cooperative card game featuring the fantastic rainbow art by the visionary artist, Aurora. The object of the game is to work together to build as many of the seven rainbows as possible. The game may be lost if players are not able to complete a rainbow, but this game is designed to be a positive game that focuses on improving and not so much the negative connotations of losing. Players work to improve their score from their last game. Though cooperative, players have limited table talk and must coordinate their card plays based on what cards they can see on the table.</description>

Banners of the Red, White, Green, and Blue factions wave in the stands as the fans cheer on their favorite drivers and teams.

<description>In City Council each player takes the role of a council member of a newly founded city. The government will select the members of the city council for the first few years until the city rises and flourishes, by which time the most popular member will receive the position of Mayor.In order to build the city, you and the other councilmen must maintain a low level of pollution, fight crime, create jobs, and sustain an adequate city budget. If you and the others don't keep up the good work, the city project might not succeed, the government will take over, and all players will lose.As a member of the council, you must also strive to gain the favor of the different political groups who rule the streets of your city. As the game progresses and the city grows larger, more and more political interest groups will try to impose their will on the city by knocking on your office door and asking you for small "favors" in which you will have to act on their behalf. In return, they'll offer you their support and you'll receive victory points for your personal cause, possibly allowing you to become the city's first Mayor.</description>

<description>Clacks: A Discworld Board Gameis based on the "Clacks" semaphore messaging system — the fastest (non-magical) messaging system on the Discworld — featured in Sir Terry Pratchett's novelGoing Postal.Using a semaphore system of shuttered lamps on top of high towers, the Grand Trunk Semaphore Company has revolutionized long-distance communications on the Discworld. Their network of towers covers most of the Unnamed Continent, but now the old postal service is fighting back. Driven by the determination of newly "volunteered" Post Master Moist Von Lipwig, the Ankh-Morpork Post Office has challenged the Clacks operators to a race from Ankh-Morpork to Genua.Play against your friends and claim the title of Fastest Clacks Operator on the line, or play together as a team to win the race across the Discworld and prove that Clacks is here to stay. In more detail,Clacks: A Discworld Board Gamecontains rules for a player vs. player game, a co-operative race game against the Post Office, and a children's introductory game.</description>

Meant to provide the world with unlimited clean energy, the Mobius Ring malfunctioned, bathing Dr. Strobal in radiation, and creating a singularity that threatens to consume the world. We need him back, and the only way to revive him from his coma is to enter his subconscious and free him from the demons found within.</description>

<description>Conan, designed by Fred Henry and based on the Conan universe by Robert E. Howard, is a scenario-based semi-cooperative asymmetric miniatures board game. One player is the Opponent, playing the Opposition forces, and the other players (1 to 4) play Conan and his companions: Shevatas the thief, Hadrathus the Priest/Sorcerer, Belit the pirate queen, Valeria the warrior, etc. The game is based purely on Robert E. Howard's novels and short stories (and not the movies or other non-Howardian material). The publisher has hired Patrice Louinet, a Howard expert, to make sure the art and the scenarios are compatible with Howard's vision.</description>

<description>Far to the South of Conan's home there lies a dry, arid land where a rugged, dark-skinned people eke as much of a life as they can out of the sands. The environment is not the only danger in these lands however, there is a darker, more sinister power at work, one that man should have known to leave well enough alone but the promise of power is too tempting for some. Now the dead rest uneasily beneath the sands and monstrous beasts devour men like cattle as the great and powerful watch on, eternally.</description>

<description>Earth has been connected to the fantasy world of Laris. The result of the mixture of technology and magic is the Cataclysm, an event that tore holes in the fabric of time and space. Five heroes have been pulled together on Laris, where they embark on a journey to mend both worlds.Consequentialis a co-operative board game that lets players live the tale of this adventure. Over the course of four acts, the story will be told. The base game box contains the board, and all the cards for Act I. Acts II, III, and IV are packaged and sold separately. They contain additional cards, new locations, and new mechanics!The unique aspect of this game is that it is not solely a tabletop experience. A free companion app for your iOS/Android device or laptop is required for play. It will display voice-acted events that are triggered by actions in the physical game, and tell more of the story. The app also is responsible for keeping the timer for the real-time portion of each episode. One episode of Consequential contains a turn-based phase (about 45 minutes) and a real-time phase (about 10 minutes) to conclude the session. The real-time phase can be played without a timer, if players prefer.</description>

<description>Fremde Federn, which means roughly "to adorn oneself with borrowed plumes," or something like "false feathers."Fremde Federn is about borrowing elements from well-known games (Eurogames) and constructing a new game out of them. For now, it is a deck-building, worker-placement, drafting race game. The print-and-play files – German only for now – are available on the 2F-Spiele website.You are a politician who tries to gather enough money and influence to become the next president. Of course, you depend on the work of others to get the needed influence. You start with a set of 10 cards (7 of them are "fatherly friends," which give you 1 money each and 3 of them yield 1 influence each (VPs)). Each round you draw 5 cards from your deck and use one card for the turn order to place your workers. The workers go to the different offices in the government building to buy new cards for you, get influence or to carry out other actions. Each round there is one more space in which you can choose to place your workers. On the game board is a row of cards which you can choose to buy and each round the empty places in this row are filled from a deck of cards divided into 4 different "Ages." The last cards of the deck are Doctoral degrees which you can buy with your money; these give you 1 VP for each unit of money spent. The game ends when all of the Doctoral degrees are bought or when one player has 95 VPs or more.</description>

<description>In the modular game Countdown: Special Ops, you are in charge of a special ops team with a special mission! Find hidden bombs and dismantle them, help hostages into safety, or take out terrorist leaders. Due to the high variation in goals, targets, threats and specific circumstances, players need to choose their set-up and strategy each time they start a mission or a campaign. Don't just throw in grenades with your buster at public places such as airports and train stations, or else civilians might get hurt, resulting in negative points on your mission balance. (Plus, you know, injuring civilians is not cool.) Develop your primary skill, but don't neglect your attack power, defense power and other skills if you want to stay alive in this thrilling new game.Countdown: Special Ops is fully modular, with players being able to create their own game by adjusting four different aspects of play:DevelopmentYou can develop your own Special Op by improving his or her skills. This is done in scenario or campaign play. This brings out interesting aspects of the game in which you have to choose how many risk you want to take to gain extra experience or if you want to move slow and stay alive at all cost...This variation, combined with the 30-minute time limit per mission, makes the experience of a mission "feel" like an actual PC game in many aspects. Smart development is essential to survive the missions on higher threat levels.</description>

<description>Coyote is a simple bluffing game in a western setting. Every player gets a card (bound on his forehead by a fabric tape) showing a number of "hidden" Indians or a special value. You don't know the value of your card, but you can see all the others. The object of the game is to guess how many Indians are shown on the cards, declaring an increasing number every turn. If you are caught over declaring, you lose.Many special cards make every game turn a surprise, and don't forget you never know the card you are showing on your forehead.The game has been reprinted by the italian company Oliphante in 2010.Starting 2011, the french company Gigamic has got international rights and the game has been printed and distributed in a brand new edition.</description>

<description>Damage Report is a modular, 2-6 player, simultaneous, real-time, co-operative game where the players take on the role of a starship crew faced with making split-second decisions to survive while in the midst of various catastrophes. Unlike many co-operative games, the simultaneous, real-time nature of the game helps prevent groupthink. This forces players to make decisions with minimal feedback and prevents one player from simply running the show. Your turn never ends, and is only limited to what you can accomplish in 15, 30, 45 or 60 second intervals.Each player uses a timer to keep track of their time, moving the timer down a track based upon how long their turn interval is. In most scenarios, the turn interval is based upon the Life Support system status: the more damaged the system is, the less air the player has to "breathe", thus each turn is extended, as it takes more time to complete their actions.The modular board pieces in Damage Report ensure a brand new experience with each game scenario. Each scenario has their own 'success' and 'failure' conditions. The Standard Edition of the game includes three scenarios, however a number of additional scenarios will available as expansions. This will include a 7-10 player expansion.</description>

For all that you will fight stronger, more cunning, and more agile opponents, complacency will hasten your end at its hands all the same. Can you triumph over the Asylum Demon, or will your corpse soon be another to roam the Asylum with the hollowed?</description>

<description> Darkest Night, by designer Jeremy Lennert, is a fully-cooperative board game for one to four players (up to six with variants), set in a kingdom broken under a necromancer’s shadow. Each player takes on the role of one of the kingdom’s last heroes (nine playable characters), each with a unique set of special abilities, just as they hatch a plan to save the realm.Searching the kingdom provides new powers and equipment to strengthen you and your party, as well as the keys that can unlock the holy relics and defeat the necromancer. You can acquire many powerful abilities—unique to each hero—that can help to fight the undead, elude the necromancer’s forces, accelerate your searches for items and artifacts, and more. The knight is a brave and powerful warrior; the prince can rally and inspire the people; the scholar excels at locating and restoring the treasures of the past.But ravenous undead roam the realm, and as the necromancer continues to build his power base, he blights the land and his army steadily grows. As the game wears on, the necromancer becomes more and more powerful, creating blights more quickly and effectively. If an area becomes too blighted, it gets overrun—and the monastery receives the spillover. And if the monastery is ever overrun, the necromancer wins and the kingdom is swallowed in darkness!Before the monastery falls, it's up to you and your party to defeat the necromancer in one of two ways: If you can gather three holy relics and bring them all back to the monastery, you can perform a powerful ritual to break the necromancer’s power and scour the land of the undead. Alternatively, you can try to defeat the necromancer in direct combat—but be warned, he will readily sacrifice his minions to save himself.Can you save the kingdom from darkness? Do you have the courage, the cunning and the will to withstand the necromancer and his forces? Strategize, plan and bring out the best of your abilities to end our Darkest Night!Game Data:Complexity: 4.5 on a 9 scaleSolitaire Suitability: 9 on a 9 scaleScale: Each unit represents a Hero, the Necromancer or blights in a guerilla war over a small kingdom. Each round represents approximately several days to a week.</description>

<description> The postcards in every local drug store read, "Welcome to Fabulous Farmingdale!", an ad campaign that was the brainchild of Mayor Hernandez (who coincidentally employed his wife's public relations firm to market their community). But right now, things are far from fabulous in Farmingdale and, for once, everyone isn't blaming the Mayor. Some kind of virus or poison is turning ordinary people into vicious, zombie-like killers. It is not clear how the disease spreads (though it seems that physical contact is certainly one way), but it is obvious what the illness does to its victims.These undead, nicknamed "Zeds" from the local newscasts as the acronym for "Zombie Epidemic Disease," are now converging on your corner of the world around Farmingdale. As best you can tell, you have been left to your own devices to stop them while the National Guard organizes a relief column, but that could take days, perhaps weeks, for them to fight their way to you and until then, what can you do?With little choice between survival and a gruesome (un)death, you realize that you must coordinate the defense of the town of Farmingdale and its surrounding villages. You must lead the good citizens and emerging heroes of these communities to halt the Zeds' advances by (re)killing them, attempt to coordinate the discovery of a cure to this vile scourge, and preserve as much of the area and as many of its inhabitants as possible. There's no time to lose... </description>

<description>"Crossroads" is a new series from Plaid Hat Games that tests a group of survivors' ability to work together and stay alive while facing crises and challenges from both outside and inside.Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game, the first game in this series, puts 2-5 players in a small, weakened colony of survivors in a world where most of humanity is either dead or diseased, flesh-craving monsters. Each player leads a faction of survivors with dozens of different characters in the game.Dead of Winter is a meta-cooperative psychological survival game. This means players are working together toward one common victory condition — but for each individual player to achieve victory, he must also complete his personal secret objective. This secret objective could relate to a psychological tick that's fairly harmless to most others in the colony, a dangerous obsession that could put the main objective at risk, a desire for sabotage of the main mission, or (worst of all) vengeance against the colony! Certain games could end with all players winning, some winning and some losing, or all players losing. Work toward the group's goal, but don't get walked all over by a loudmouth who's looking out only for his own interests!Dead of Winter is an experience that can be accomplished only through the medium of tabletop games. It's a story-centric game about surviving through a harsh winter in an apocalyptic world. The survivors are all dealing with their own psychological imperatives, but must still find a way to work together to fight off outside threats, resolve crises, find food and supplies, and keep the colony's morale up.Dead of Winter has players making frequent, difficult, heavily- thematic, wildly-varying decisions that often have them deciding between what is best for the colony and what is best for themselves.</description>

<description>The zombie apocalypse has begun, and you and your friends take on the roles of various characters who are all working to survive.In Dead Panic, each player takes on the role of one of eight unique characters, which have special abilities. Players work together to survive in a remote cabin, at the center of the board, against waves of the undead that close in from the edges of the board. If the players can hold out, survivors bring pieces of the radio needed to call for rescue. Once rescue arrives, it's up to each player to leave the safety of the cabin and make it out alive!To fight the zombies, players use cabin cards, some of which are weapons that help players attack zombies at a distance or in hand-to-hand combat. If characters take too many injuries during combat, they die and return to the game as a zombie with customized rules as a member of the undead! Other cabin cards are items, which give the players various benefits and a better chance at survival. The supply of items and weapons is limited, however. Once the cabin deck is exhausted, it is not reshuffled. A separate deck of cards, called event cards, allow the zombies to have their turn. This deck not only brings a variety of zombies into play but each card also has a special effect when drawn.Can you survive Dead Panic? </description>

<description>New York, the city that never sleeps. According to the high and mighty, things were supposed to be different in the Big Apple in 1938. No more poverty. Medicine that works. Shining skyscrapers and subway cars, the new age upon us. Sure. So why am I in the same dingy office, with a cheap desk and a cheaper secretary, paid to find a missing husband somewhere out in the mean streets? Simple job, except my wealthy socialite employer was hiding something. She was a good looker but a bad liar. I grabbed my hat and gun. I slipped a flask into the pocket of my overcoat. I was ready to wade into the cesspool.</description>

<description>Defenders of The Last Standis a post apocalyptic adventure game by Richard Launius (Arkham Horror,Run Fight or Die,Defenders of the Realm) for 1-5 players set in the Western United States more than 50 years after nuclear war. Players take on the roles of Defenders of the last known haven for humanity, called The Last Stand. Four outside clans leaders, along with their followers, advance toward the town, and players work cooperatively to defend The Last Stand. Menacing mutants also roam the desert threatening the city's survival. The game will introduce player character mutations - your character can mutate from travel into irradiated areas. Gameplay will consist of both elements of adventure and conflict resolution, and Defenders of the Last Stand will come loaded with miniatures, including three large sculpted miniatures of the invading Clan leaders as well as their minions - sculpted by Chad Hoverter. The four warrior clans include raiders on bikes and in cars, another group of mutated humans who ride large beasts, third clan consisting of techno savvy, yet criminally insane youths, and finally a large winged creature so mutated that he has lost all traces of his old humanity."Today we discovered a fallen caravan not fifteen miles up dry road. I had been that way to visit Auntie's just recently and there weren't no caravans, fallen or otherwise, there before. This means the Raiders have been circling the last stand for at least the last two weeks. Pepzi asked me to stay a while in case they attack. No more scavenging for now, she said. "Something is brewing. The air hurts my lungs. I see shadows in the hillside." The airismore dry than usual. My lips have all but cracked off. Doc gives me salve to put on them, but I tell him to keep it for the kids. New families are appearing in Stanfield. It's a good site to see. We are finally surviving a bit, and bringing kids into this world again. I'm thinking of how in the good book we are told to be multiply. It's God's will, but most would say this land has been forsaken by God, but I'm hoping we can start again. Me, I'm hoping for the best, but my bones tell me there is no best."The Last Stand was known as Stanfield back in the old world, before the great war. While battles raged in the cities across America and the world, as far as we know, some old-schoolers, cowboys, fighters, and drifters came together in this desert to escape the end of the world. The desert was only the safe place and Detroit says it's where a man learns to be a man. Detroit told me that Stanfield changed its name to The Last Stand back then. Cause it was the last fighting chance for humanity. Detroit knows lots of stories. He is old and claims he was alive in those days, 80 something years ago, back when they played something called baseball and Nitena. I don't know what to believe from his mouth, but he is a hoot to listen to. Course, he has been around a long time, changed by the Radiation – mutated like many folks, but still as human as human can be, unlike the raiders. Detroit is one of us now. He knows stuff and and we are going to fight tooth and nail against the raiders wanting to take what we worked so hard to build. Rumor is that they have merged, and I reckon they will have to to capture this city. We are bonded together. Even got a little ancient technology and oil. Bad stuff maybe since it is what brought us here. We'll use it carefully. The Last Stand may be our last hope. I don't know if there are any other cities out there worth fighting for."--Taken from the Journal of Marha Bourne Star</description>

<description>Everyone knows that on the U.S. frontier in the days of the Wild West, a person could work hard as a settler who establishes a hotel or saloon or as a prospector who mines for gold and other treasures – or a person could try to take the easy way out by robbing all those who did the hard work.In Desperados, players are card sharpers, highwaymen or bank robbers who want to "earn" what they need to live out the rest of their lives in comfort. Well, most players fall into that category, but one takes the role of marshal and tries to keep the other players honest.During set-up, a money tile is placed in each bank, a poker tile in each city without a bank, and a stagecoach in a randomly-determined city. Each outlaw starts in a city, and the marshal has both a marshal token and a number of sheriffs equal to the number of outlaws, with these tokens starting wherever the marshal places them.The game lasts five turns, with five movement cards played by each player in each turn. Each player has an individual hand of movement cards, including a "Saloon" card that allows a player to stay in the same location. The marshal moves the stagecoach, moves each sheriff (or leaves them in place), then the marshal and the outlaws alternate laying five face-down movement cards. If an outlaw wants to take an action in a city – robbing a bank, a card game, or a stagecoach – he must show his location card to the marshal, then place his wooden disk on that location.Once all five movement cards have been placed, the players all reveal the first card and move their tokens. If the marshal is in the same city as an outlaw, that player is jailed and loses all movement and action for the remainder of the turn; that player also loses that movement card for the remainder of the game. If an outlaw is in a location with his action disk, he can take that action – as long as more outlaws are present than sheriffs. (Players pool their money, so there's no dispute over which outlaw robbed a place.)Once players finish their five movements, they pick up all their movement cards, the marshal replaces stolen tiles (and adds a second stagecoach in the second turn), and a new turn begins. If at the end of the game, the desperados have collected $4,000 or more per outlaw, then they win the game; otherwise the marshal wins as the outlaws – despite stealing huge amounts of funds – have not secured enough funds to guarantee their livelihood in their golden years.</description>

<description>In Die verzauberten Rumpelriesen, the magician players want to find imps hiding in the leaves that cover the forest floor around them – but they must search carefully to find these imps so that they don't wake the sleeping giants guarding the land. Oh, and they'll need to search quickly, too, or else the giants will wake from the sleeping spell cast on them and run the searchers out of the forest. Who can combine speed, control and a good memory to find the imps where they hide?To set up, players place the 16 imp tokens in the holes on the game board, cover these imps with the 85 cardboard leaves included in the game, then place one large wooden giant on each corner of the board. On a turn, the active player reveals a search card showing one of the imps. An opponent flips the sand timer, then the player uses her magic wand to push the leaves aside and (fingers crossed!) find the imp on the search card. She can use her wand to move the giants as well, but if they fall off the game board – or even so much as a single leaf falls – the giants awaken and chase the player away empty-handed. If the player reveals the target imp, though, she keeps the search card to record her find. After each search, players cover the board again and return the giants to their places. In the end, whoever has collected the most search cards wins!</description>

<description>Direwild is a fully co-operative, tactical, dungeon-crawling deck-builder. There is no dungeon master; it is purely the players vs. the game. Players assume the role of animists, heroes that can summon creatures both great and small (represented in the cards you build your deck with), then combine those creatures in unique ways. With the creatures' help, the animists strive to work as a team to defeat the evil forces of Karn. Karn was once a great animist himself, but was corrupted by his lust for greater power. Throughout the game, Karn tries to hunt the heroes and defeat them before they can grow strong enough to face him in the final showdown. The game is split into three chapters, with a "game save" mechanism to allow for the packing and saving of the game between game nights.</description>

Your goal: Work together as a team to save a patient who just arrived on a stretcher before time runs out!To accomplish this, you need to perform a series of medical treatments that have been prepared before the game. One or more players serve as overseers — emergency room managers, as it were — and they give tasks to the other medical personnel on hand: find a combination of drugs in this batch of cards; figure out the dose you need to administer by consulting this chart; stitch up a wound by "stitching" on a game board with needle and thread; and so on. If you complete all of the treatments before the final heart attack on the soundtrack, you are victorious! If not, you'll have to receive additional training...</description>

<description>In DuCo, players score points by playing cards so that colored icons lie next to one another. If you match color or shape, you score; match both, and you score more; match special symbols, and the bonus points will roll in. Some icons will match any color or shape, giving you more opportunities to score. The options for where to play grow each turn, and the first player to reach 50 points wins!</description>

<description>Dungeon Crawler is an adventure card game that is playable alone or with friends. You get to choose Adventurers, equip them, design your own Quests to conquer, seek out the evils that terrorize the lands, and save the Damsel. This intelligently designed game pulls together extraordinary art and fantasy flavor that can keep you spellbound in epic adventure.The creators of Dungeon Crawler pit your Adventurers against a series of perilous encounters deep within the domain of vile adversaries and insidious plot combinations, which they must strategically overcome. This collectible starter includes 2 decks that support single player gaming. You can also use the starter in competitive and co-operative formats (provided that you or your friends have enough cards to support the format you have chosen to play). One is a 65 card grey-tone deck, known as the Dungeon deck. The other deck bears a similar logo with a blue backing. This deck is known as the Crawler deck which serves as a “bag of tricks” for your Adventurers.</description>

<description>Castle Ravenloft Boardgame by Bill Slavicsek, Mike Mearls and Peter LeeThe master of Ravenloft is having guests for dinner – and you are invited!Evil lurks in the towers and dungeons of Castle Ravenloft, and only heroes of exceptional bravery can survive the horrors within. Designed for 1-5 players, this boardgame features multiple scenarios, challenging quests, and cooperative gameplay.Each player selects a hero; a ranger, rogue, warrior, cleric, or wizard. On their turn, each player can explore further into the dungeon (turn over new tiles), move through the already explored parts of the dungeon, and fight monsters. When a new dungeon tile is revealed, there is typically an encounter of some sort, and new monsters to fight are added. Slain monsters reward the players with treasure, and experience points, allowing them to level up and increase their skills during play. Players must cooperate to stay alive, slay the monsters, and achieve the goal of their quest. Each scenario has a different goal - from retrieving a relic, to slaying a vampire lord.</description>

<description>It is 1926, and the museum's extensive collection of exotic curios and occult artifacts poses a threat to the barriers between our world and the elder evils lurking between dimensions. Gates to the beyond begin to leak open, and terrifying creatures of increasing strength steal through them. Animals, the mad, and those of more susceptible minds are driven to desperation by the supernatural forces the portals unleash. Only a handful of investigators race against time to locate the eldritch symbols necessary to seal the portals forever. Only they can stop the Ancient One beyond from finding its way to Earth and reducing humanity to cinders.Elder Sign is a fast-paced, cooperative dice game of supernatural intrigue for one to eight players by Richard Launius and Kevin Wilson, the designers of Arkham Horror. Players take the roles of investigators racing against time to stave off the imminent return of the Ancient One. Armed with tools, allies, and occult knowledge, investigators must put their sanity and stamina to the test as they adventure to locate Elder Signs, the eldritch symbols used to seal away the Ancient Ones and win the game.To locate Elder Signs, investigators must successfully endure Adventures within the museum and its environs. A countdown mechanism makes an Ancient One appear if the investigators are not quick enough. The investigators must then battle the Ancient One. A clever and thematic dice mechanism pits their exploration against monsters and the sheer difficulty of staying sane and healthy, all within the standard game duration of one to two hours.</description>

<description> Twenty years ago, during the Klondike Gold Rush, over a hundred thousand prospectors traveled deep into the Alaskan territory. Most of them perished in the ice, a few got rich, and some awoke terrible, ancient evils. Now, down in usually temperate Arkham, the winds are blowing harder and colder than ever before. The Miskatonic has frozen over. Some people complain of insatiable hunger and sometimes the newspapers even report cannibalism. You know all too well that the Ancient Ones are causing the weather and hunger, but this time you cannot fight them from within the Arkham Museum, or even out on Arkham’s streets. You must brave the brutal conditions that killed thousands of prospectors, and fight ferocious creatures from this world and others, or else the cold, hunger, and ice will devastate humanity.Omens of Icetakes you and your fellow investigators on a treacherous journey into the Alaskan wildernesses, where you must solve the mysteries of three terrible new Ancient Ones. Whether you choose to travel in summer or are forced to go in winter’s dark, at every step you’ll face terrible perils, from the port of Anchorage to the forest paths and mountain passes of the interior. You must constantly fight not only wild animals and ravenous monsters, but frostbite, starvation, and the madness that befalls many who enter this frozen, isolated, white world. </description>

<description>Unseen Forces, an expansion for Elder Sign, brings a fresh challenge to the efforts of the investigators in this cooperative dice game set in the world of H.P. Lovecraft's weird fiction. The museum harbors artifacts that draw the attention of horrible beings, and the unfathomable wills of these creatures make themselves known in the form of blessings and curses. Four new Ancient Ones, eight new investigators, and several new monsters accompany the introduction of these powers, and the entrance of the museum has been remodeled thanks to four Entrance Cards, which give investigators more ways to spend their turn if they'd rather not attempt an adventure.Blessings and curses work their power in Unseen Forces through the introduction of a white and a black die. A blessed investigator gains the Blessed card and adds a white die to the player's dice pool, giving him an extra icon to use to complete his tasks. Being cursed forces a player to take the Cursed card and roll the black die along with the rest of his dice pool. If the player rolls any die that matches the result on the black die, he must discard both from his pool immediately.</description>

<description>Information from publishers game pageOperation Chastise: the Dambuster RaidOn the night of May 16, 1943, nineteen Lancaster bombers of 617 Squadron took off from their base near Lincoln in Great Britain and headed for the heart of German industry in the Ruhr. The squadron’s task was to destroy the dams that controlled the reservoirs feeding Germany’s war engine. In the words of aeronautical engineer Barnes Wallis, the mastermind behind the operation, “power is dependant on the supply of natural stores of energy such as coal, oil and water.... If their destruction or paralysis can be accomplished THEY OFFER A MEANS OF RENDERING THE ENEMY UTTERLY INCAPABLE OF CONTINUING TO PROSECUTE THE WAR.”The Lancasters had been modified to carry a most unusual ordnance codenamed Upkeep. It looked more like a petrol barrel than an explosive device, but the painstakingly engineered and tested outer layer cushioned a volatile mine designed by Wallis to bounce over torpedo nets and kiss the lip of the dam, its backspin carefully devised to hug the dam rather than ricochet on impact. Upkeep was supposed to plunge down along the wall like a depth-charge, detonating halfway down. The concussion would crack the structure, and the water’s mass held back by the dam would push open the crack, creating a breach in the wall. The dam would be destroyed.Eight of the Lancasters would not return that night, but the two primary targets of the Möhne and Eder dams were breached, letting loose a combined torrent that measured nearly half a million tons of water and taking the lives of over 1200 German civilians and military personnel. Measured in civilian casualties, it was the most lethal night of the bombing campaign thus far, although later missions would dwarf its casualty list. Measured in terms of industrial disruption, the raid cut the region’s electrical power for several hours and severely reduced its water reservoir. It was not a decisive blow, but it was successful nonetheless. Had at least one other dam been breached, it could have been devastating. This is your challenge: can you match 617’s success? Can you surpass it?The GameIn Enemy Coast Ahead: The Dambuster Raid, you command a newly formed squadron assigned the task of breaching the dams in the Ruhr Valley. Not only are you presented with a variety of decisions, you play the invisible hand of fate as your crews endure the hazards of a dangerous night raid. Play the campaign and you get to organize and train the squadron, or play the historical scenarios.PlayersPlay solitaire and you do it all. Play with teammates and one of you is the squadron commander giving orders to subordinates. The squadron commander wins if the dams are breached, while subordinates compete to accomplish their orders with the least casualties to the men and machines assigned to them. Only one subordinate will win. Of course, if the dams are not breached, you all lose.Scale &amp;amp; DetailEach Lancaster is represented by its own 1” counter. Each bomber will carry two or three 5/8” markers representing aircrew, ordnance and possibly an elite crewman. All the men awarded decorations before or during the raid are represented in this game by their own marker, each imparting a unique characteristic to its crew. Even the squadron commander’s dog gets his own marker!Ground crew are also featured in the campaign game, represented by markers rated for a variety of tasks. You will have to requisition and manage your Erks effectively while maintaining security. That’s not so easy. You may find it necessary to transfer the local barmaid or take the drastic measure of transferring 54 squadron out of Scampton airbase, or even quarantining the base altogether.Reconnaissance is crucial. In the campaign game you will need to survey the defenses of the dams and the routes to them, but too much recon and you risk tipping off the enemy. But how much is too much? You will have to target the right dams or the right combination of dams, to get the job done. Möhne and Eder are the juiciest targets, but what if they are well defended? Do you risk it, or go for the other dams hoping to breach enough of them to achieve your goal?Training is vital. In the campaign game you will requisition and then train your crew to fly at exceptionally low altitude, maintain a steady speed, locate the target in the dead of night, and release ordnance at precisely the right distance from the lip of the dam. You will only have just so much time to prepare your squadron. You might have to decide what is more important: learning to maintain the right altitude and speed while preparing to release ordnance, or the ability to find the dam? If your men don’t master these skills quickly you may have to favor one over the other. You can always impose extra training, but push your men too hard and they become fatigued, perhaps even damaging their bomber in training or worse, crashing it. And if you don’t push them enough you may run out of time. The moon will be right only for so long and the reservoirs are slowly rising. Once full, the Germans will open the valves and release the water, making them that much harder to breach. The clock is ticking.The game board is organized into three sections, the Mission Planning Blotter, the Flight Map (from Scampton to the Ruhr), and the Target Maps. The first scenarios use only the Target Maps, while larger scenarios will use them as well as the Flight Map. Only the campaign game takes full advantage of the Planning Mission Blotter, allowing you to organize and train your squadron, assign tasks to ground crew, and modify the Lancasters for this unique raid. The Lancasters were modified in a number of ways for Operation Chastise:top-turret and armor were removed to compensate for the weight of the bouncing bomb (yes, those bombers were sitting ducks for Nightfighters).VHF radio sets were installed to allow better command and control while over the target (they were standard in fighters but this was the first time a bomber’s cockpit was fitted with them).Dann bombsight. pair of Aldis spotlights rigged to judge the bomber’s altitude over the reservoir.The Target Maps are intended to portray (and analyze) four key elements in a bomber’s attack: altitude, speed, distance from the dam, and the angle of approach to the face of the dam’s wall. During an attack you will strive for the perfect angle, the ideal speed and altitude, adjusting one or more of these before releasing Upkeep at just the right distance from the dam (“Upkeep” was the codename for the bouncing bomb). You may choose to pull-up rather than release ordnance, circling around for another run, because finding that sweet spot is tricky and each Lancaster has only one bomb to drop. You’ve got to make it count.Campaign GameThe full campaign game begins with the forming of the squadron weeks before the raid. The player assumes the role of squadron leader or one of his subordinates in team play, requisitioning bombers, ground crew, and aircrew. He must train the aircrews and results are variable. Veterans tend to get more out of training than less experienced crews, but there is always the possibility of damaging and even crashing bombers, and losing or exhausting crews in training. As Air Vice Marshal Cochrane explained to 617’s Wing Commander: “Now there’s a lot of urgency in this, because you haven’t got long to train. Training will be the important thing, so get going right away.”Meanwhile, the player may order recon missions along the flight path and over the dams, garnering information that will help him devise a target list. There are 7 dams that can be attacked, but it is unlikely the player will have the resources to hit them all (there’s nothing stopping him from trying). Before launching the attack the player would like to know which dams are defended by flak, searchlights and balloons, and how high the reservoir is (the higher the better, but too high and the Germans may soon open the valves and reduce the water-level, so timing is crucial). Too much recon can tip off the Germans, however, which means that the fog of war is a very important aspect of the design. The player won't know if security has been compromised until the flight is already underway. As Wing Commander Gibson explained to the men of 617 squadron: “When the other boys ask you what you’re doing, just tell them to mind their own business, because of all things in this game, security is the greatest factor.”All this planning and preparation ends when the player decides his squadron is ready and he launches the raid. The player then organizes his squadron into waves, assigning aircrew to Lancasters, arming them with ordnance, and assigning primary and secondary targets, and wave leaders. Once launched, bombers are likely to encounter hazards along the flight path -- flak and searchlights of course, but also utility poles and trees. Historically, 617 squadron flew low enough to hit sea waves and electrical cables (the player may choose to fly high, but that risks encountering nightfighters, an even more lethal threat). Along the route bombers might experience engine trouble or lose their way. Navigation training pays off during the flight turns (each turn represents one hour of historical time).Upon reaching and acquiring the target, the player uses target maps to play attack turns, each representing approximately 8 minutes of historical time. Here each bomber has to negotiate the dam's immediate terrain and defenses (if any -- recon missions might have revealed that some dams are undefended, making them prime targets, but if security has been compromised the player may discover that the Germans have added defenses). There is an approach sequence where the player must resolve the attack of each bomber on the target map, striving for the perfect speed and altitude, hopefully releasing the bouncing mine at precisely the right distance from the dam. There is the possibility of being jumped by nightfighters if the attack is prolonged, motivating the player to get the job done promptly.And finally, the player resolves the fate of returning bombers as well as those that lost their way, and then conducts a morning-after recon mission verifying the damage he inflicted on the dams. A dam that was only damaged may have weakened and breached by morning, or conversely, the reports of your exuberant bomber crews may prove to have been exaggerated.The ScenariosThe game is also presented in nine scenarios, each isolating a particular aspect of Operation Chastise. In fact, the rules are organized in program-fashion, the first section explains the attack rules. The first few scenarios can thus be played after just reading those rules. The first scenario, for example, treats the action over the Möhne reservoir, while subsequent scenarios incorporate more of the mission (and more rules) until the player is ready to undertake the campaign game encompassing the entire operation from training to bombing and return.</description>

There are dinosaurs to dodge, time rifts to close, and castaways from other eras who got pulled back due to paradoxes. Each time traveler has unique abilities and stats which will aid in repairing the time ship. You must be careful not to disrupt the timeline too much or the volcano will erupt, wiping out proof of the expedition altogether.</description>

<description>Note: This is not a standalone product and you'll need the base gameEscape: The Curse of the Templeto play.Escape: Illusions includes two new modules for the Escape base game that can be used individually or mixed with any other available modules.The "Illusion Chambers" module consists of six chamber tiles that replace the tiles with only one magic gem in the basic game. After players return to the starting chamber during the game – something they must do twice in order to avoid losing a die – all illusion chambers in play are removed and returned to the bottom of the tile deck. Hopefully you already completed your business in any section of the temple now disconnected from the rest!The "Special Chambers" module consists of six new chamber tiles, divided as follows:Three linked chamber tiles that allow you to activate magic gems, thereby making it easier for the adventurers to escape the temple – but the gems can be activated only if players are in two separate such chambers at the same time.Two double chamber tiles that consist of a front and back room, with access to the back room being available only if you add tiles to the temple and snake around to the back. Why do you want to reach this room? More opportunities to activate magic gems and ease your way out of the temple.One treasure chamber tile, containing a chalice that adventurers must bear to the exit tile. If they fail to do so, they lose the game – even if they otherwise would all escape!Components for a sixth player are included, as well as two copies each of one new curse card ("Soul Exchange") and one new treasure tile ("Large Torch").</description>

At set-up the quest tiles are shuffled separately, and 1-3 of them are then shuffled (unseen) into the deck. This means you never know what challenges you will face.Character module: Each player plays one of six different characters: Doc, Mechanic, Discoverer, Dark Priest, Muscleman, Mentalist. Each character comes with two unique abilities, and at the start of the game you pick one. </description>

<description>Escape: The Curse of the Temple is a cooperative game in which players must escape (yes...) from a temple (yes...) which is cursed (yes...) before the temple collapses and kills one or more explorers, thereby causing everyone to lose.The initial game board consists of a row of three square tiles, each showing a combination of two symbols, say, two green adventurers or one green adventurer and one blue key in one corner of the tile. All of the explorers start in the center tile – the safe room – and each player starts with a hand of five dice. Each die has five symbols:A cursed mask – this die is set aside when rolled.A golden mask – each such symbol counteracts two cursed masks, either your own or those of another explorer in the same room.A red torch or blue key – these are used to enter rooms, access treasure, or activate gems.A green adventurer, which appears twice on the die – you need these to move from room to room, and to activate some gems.Escape is played in real-time, with all players rolling dice and taking actions simultaneously. You must roll the right symbols to enter a room, and if you're at an open doorway, you can roll to reveal the next tile in the stack and add it to that doorway. Some rooms contain combinations of red and blue symbols, and if you (possibly working with other players in the same room) roll enough red or blue symbols, you "discover" magic gems, moving them from a separate gem depot onto that tile.The real-time aspect is enforced by a soundtrack to be played during the game. At certain points, a countdown starts, and if players aren't back in the safe room when time is up, they lose one of their dice.Once the exit tile is revealed, players can attempt to escape the temple by moving to that tile, then rolling a number of blue dice equal to the magic gems that haven't been removed from the gem depot. Thus, the more gems you find, the easier it is to escape the temple. When a player escapes, he gives one die to a player of his choice. If all players escape before the third countdown, everyone wins; if not, everyone loses, no matter how many players did escape.Escape: The Curse of the Temple includes two expansion modules that can be used individually or together. With the "Treasures" module, some rooms contain treasure, and when you reveal such a room, you place a face-down treasure chest on the tile. Roll the symbols on that chest tile, and you claim the treasure for use later: a key lets you teleport anywhere, a path lets you connect two rooms that otherwise have no door between them, and a medic kit heals all players instantly (putting black dice back into play). With the "Curses" module, some tiles "curse" players by forcing them to place one hand on their head, keep mute during play, or otherwise do what you wouldn't want to do while escaping a temple!</description>

Everything is going great — well, as great as it can be when zombies are all around — but this is all about to change as a big wave of zombies is coming to town, and they want your brainy goodness. Your only option is to gather all the necessary supplies, start up the old VW Microbus, and get the hell outta Dodge (the city)!Escape from Zombie City is played with a soundtrack that lasts fifteen minutes. After that length of time, the zombie hordes have gotten too big to defeat, and you have lost your mind, so to speak...</description>

<description>On an Egyptian holiday, players are visiting the highlight of the entire journey: the stone pyramids! But after rising through the narrow, labyrinthine corridors, they discover that they've lost the rest of the group. After wandering for hours, they end up in a mysterious grave chamber — and suddenly the stone door closes behind them. The players are caught. On the floor is a sand-covered notebook and an ancient spinning code dial. Will the players escape in time or be forever buried under stone?</description>

Steam has started emerging from one of the test tubes, and they've all gotten dizzy to the point of passing out. When they awaken, they discover that the door is locked and no other way out seems possible. Only a notebook and an enigmatic spinning code dial seem to offer any clues for how to escape the lab...</description>

<description>The Dark Queen (otherwise known as the Evil Queen), the Queen of Hearts, and the Snow Queen – three of the most powerful queens of all realms join forces with the common goal of wiping out the population completely in order to start anew and create a utopia with no poverty, crime, or sickness, all designed with their vision and unquestionable control.To prevent history from repeating itself, they agree to select a champion to lead the new civilization and firmly guide the people based on knowledge from the past world. This champion must have a strong will, strength, magic, intelligence, persuasive abilities and is proven to be a survivor. Thus the Queens banished all Heroes and Villains into a fierce competition to see who will survive the Fairytale Games. There will be only one.Fairytale Games: The Battle Royaleis a 1-10 player dice-based board game that uses cards as the board (for land exploration). Movement is with a 6-sided die. When you begin the game, you and other players start at the same location and begin revealing locations/terrain as you roll your die. Some locations offer opportunities to start quests to gain survival items or allow you to explore more lands and gain better abilities. All the while Events are happening that might help or hinder you greatly. There are 30+ character cards that you can play as or fight against in this game. Other cards include Action Cards, Event Cards, Location Cards, Quest Cards and Item Cards. A normal game duration is about 30 minutes to 1 hour depending on the number of players.The goal of the game is to kill off at least ten fairytale characters in the game in addition to your opponent before they can do the same to you. If playing a one-player game, you must kill twenty characters. The other way you can win is if you complete certain Quest challenges as a team to escape the realm or to take the entire place down with you by finding the slim opportunities through certain card scenarios to defeat the three Queens.Although Action Cards allow you to strategically attack, defend, hinder, or help another player, your character cards themselves have their own special abilities that can be used during certain situations through dice rolling or if they are activated by Quests, Events or other Action Cards.</description>

<description>Monsters at the Legoblah! swamp prefer fast food nowadays. It’s quick, convenient and you can eat some of the most disgusting junk in the world. Business is good, but customers are extremely demanding; it is highly recommended you don’t keep them waiting. As soon as the customer’s order is in the kitchen, everyone must hurry to get it ready quickly. Having to explain to a slew of hungry customers why they haven’t got their food yet is no fun at all...</description>

<description>Do the job. Get paid. Aim to misbehave.Firefly: Fistful of Creditsis a two-to-four-player cooperative game where players step into the boots of Serenity’s crew to pull off a series of dangerous heists and hopefully walk away with their lives and a tidy fortune! The game features three distinct heist scenarios inspired by the episodes Bushwhacked, The Train Job, and Ariel; each with their own highly-detailed board, tokens, and Heist card, which details unique objectives from the show that must be accomplished in order to win.Players pair up any two of the nine crew members, forming unique teams that work with other players to collect gear, fight, and face both luck and misfortune while racing against the clock to complete the heist. Be careful: triggering an alarm, lollygagging around or sticking your nose in the wrong crate can open up a whole world of ugly - be it Reavers, Alliance, or the sinister Hands of Blue!Fail and it’s all over... but succeeding means you and your crew walk away with more than a fistful of credits!</description>

<description>In 1942, four soldiers vanished from the training program of the newly formed First Ranger Battalion, their names stricken from the roster. Chosen for their unique skills, they would fight in secret against terrifying supernatural enemies and overwhelming odds. This is their story.Fireteam Zerois a cooperative game for up to four players who must cut a path through an endless swarm of deadly monsters in order to discover and defeat the ultimate evil behind them. Each player possesses a set of brutal combat skills that are represented by a deck of cards unique to that character. Play cards to devastate the creatures in your way, help your teammates survive the onslaught, or even reshape the tactical landscape with the proper application of explosive ordinance. The battle is fought across three maps of increasing difficulty, each one bringing more and tougher enemies than the last. Players must search for and complete mission objectives in order to progress and bring them one step closer to the final showdown.Aiding them are two NPC Specialists, one with an uncanny ability to sense the location and nature of the supernatural energy in the area and another with an encyclopedic knowledge of the arcane. Use the Specialists wisely or risk failure no matter how many monsters you defeat.Race against time as the creatures on the board become stronger and more cunning. The longer you take to complete your objectives, the more Monster Twist cards are revealed, each granting a new and terrible aspect to your enemy. In each set of missions you will face a different family of horrifying creatures, each with their own special abilities and twist cards.Players must not only fight for their lives, but at the same time they must make smart tactical choices with their teammates in order to make the best use of a limited resource, the cards in their hands. Each card not only represents an action that they can take, but also their health. Spending too many cards can leave you vulnerable, while spending too few can result in being overwhelmed. Clever players will rely on each other to succeed.Fireteam Zerois a story-rich board game of squad tactics and horror. Each map can be played separately in about 45 minutes or together to complete an entire Operation in about three hours.Expansions:1) The Africa Cycle:Go head to head against the Thornspawn in this expansion!New Miniatures!Receive the Thornspawn, an entire new monster family.

This is what you do every day.Flash Point: Fire Rescue is a cooperative game of fire rescue.There are two versions of game play in Flash Point, a basic game and expert game.In both variants, players are attempting to rescue 7 of 10 victims from a raging building fire.As the players attempt to rescue the victims, the fire spreads to other parts of the building, causing structural damage and possibly blocking off pathways through the building. Each turn a player may spend action points to try to extinguish fires, move through the building, move victims out of the building or perform various special actions such as moving emergency vehicles. If 4 victims perish in the blaze or the building collapses from taking too much structural damage, the players lose. Otherwise, the players win instantly when they rescue a 7th victim.The expert variant included in the game adds thematic elements such as flash over, combustible materials, random setup, and variations on game difficulty from novice to heroic. The game includes a double sided board with two different building plans and several expansion maps are available.</description>

<description>Forbidden Island is a visually stunning 'cooperative' board game. Instead of winning by competing with other players like most games, everyone must work together to win the game. Players take turns moving their pawns around the 'island', which is built by arranging the many beautifully screen-printed tiles before play begins. As the game progresses, more and more island tiles sink, becoming unavailable, and the pace increases. Players use strategies to keep the island from sinking, while trying to collect treasures and items. As the water level rises, it gets more difficult- sacrifices must be made.What causes this game to truly stand out among co-op and competitive games alike is the extreme detail that has been paid to the physical components of the game. It comes in a sturdy and organized tin of good shelf storage size. The plastic treasure pieces and wooden pawns are well crafted and they fit just right into the box. The cards are durable, well printed, and easy to understand. The island tiles are the real gem: they are screen-printed with vibrant colors, each with a unique and pleasing image.For those who enjoy Forbidden Island, a follow-up project by Gamewright titled Forbidden Desert was released in 2013.From the publisher's website:Dare to discover Forbidden Island! Join a team of fearless adventurers on a do-or-die mission to capture four sacred treasures from the ruins of this perilous paradise. Your team will have to work together and make some pulse-pounding maneuvers, as the island will sink beneath every step! Race to collect the treasures and make a triumphant escape before you are swallowed into the watery abyss!</description>

<description>Early in the history of the United States, slavery was an institution that seemed unmovable but with efforts of men and women across the country, it was toppled. In Freedom: The Underground Railroad, players are working to build up the strength of the Abolitionist movement through the use of notable figures and pivotal events. By raising support for the cause and moving slaves to freedom in Canada, the minds of Americans can be changed and the institution of slavery can be brought down.Freedom is a card-driven, cooperative game for one to four players in which the group is working for the abolitionist movement to help bring an end to slavery in the United States. The players use a combination of cards, which feature figures and events spanning from Early Independence until the Civil War, along with action tokens and the benefits of their role to impact the game.Players need to strike the right balance between freeing slaves from plantations in the south and raising funds which are desperately needed to allow the group to continue their abolitionist activities as well as strengthen the cause.The goal is not easy and in addition to people and events that can have a negative impact on the group's progress, there are also slave catchers roaming the board, reacting to the movements of the slaves on the board and hoping to catch the runaway slaves and send them back to the plantations.Through careful planning and working together, the group might see an end to slavery in their time.</description>

<description>Intruders have made their way onto your ship, and their goal is total destruction! More than twenty bombs have been detected onboard, and the countdown has begun. Your elite Bomb Defusal Team (BDT) has been called upon to neutralize the threat. Does your team have what it takes to work through the intricacies of the bombs and defuse them all in time?FUSEis a real-time co-operative game that employs 25 dice and 76 cards. Each game is set to a ten minute timer, and players must work together in that ten minutes to defuse all of the bombs. Each bomb is represented by a card which needs a certain combination of dice in order to defuse it. A player will draw a number of dice equal to the number of players out of a bag and roll them. Players must then decide who will get which dice, but each player must take one and only one.It's a simple task: maximize the potential of your dice between all of the players. The problem is you only have ten minutes, and there are more than 20 bombs on your ship. You don't have time to think through every option. You barely have time to yell at Grandma as she reaches for that red die you need. This game will self destruct in 10 minutes.....</description>

<description>Galactic Strike Force is a cooperative, deck-building game in which two to six players each take control of a ship and a crew in defense of the galaxy! Dangerous opposition forces threaten to overrun the entire galaxy, and the players must not only build up their ships, but also work together tactically to stop them!However, this Strike Force is not made up of stalwart defenders, space cops or Volnethian Guardians. In Galactic Strike Force, you play as scoundrels — members of the galactic underworld! Smugglers, space pirates, gun runners, bounty hunters, and information brokers make up the ranks of the Strike Force which has come together to defend the galaxy!Galactic Strike Force takes about an hour to play and all of the players are engaged throughout the entire game. Rather than having individual turns, each player is constantly acting through the phases of the game, and each ship is in constant peril! As the game progresses, players travel from sector to sector, purchasing powerful tech upgrades for their ships and boosts to help them in battle. Then, after installing the techs, the Strike Force ships engage the opposition ships in battle throughout the galaxy!</description>

<description>Galaxy Defenders is a sci-fi cooperative, tactical battle game in which 1-5 players fight together against an oncoming alien menace. Each player takes control of one or more agents with unique powers to defend the planet from the alien invasion. Gameplay revolves around a tactical combat system, using custom ten-sided dice. Each player sequentially plays his Agent turn and then one Aliens turn. Players carry out their turns [agent and aliens] in clockwise order until the last player finishes his Aliens turn. Once done, the game passes to the Event phase that will bring the players to the next round. Players may choose up to five agents:Marine: Coming from U.S. Special Forces, the Marine is an excellent soldier who can manage different combat situations, especially multiple enemies.Biotech: The Biotech is the most technologically adept agent in service. He can use Nano-Technology to heal wounds or control war drones.Infiltrator: A deadly and stealthy agent. This lethal specialist prefers hiding in the shadows. She has fast movement and good short-range combat ability.Sniper: A silent sharpshooter and expert in camouflage and ranged combat. The sniper has average movement and excellent long-range firepower.Hulk: The Hulk was a successful mercenary and now is one of the best agents; although slow, he enjoys an extraordinary resistance to damage and has high firepower.There is no "Alien player" in Galaxy Defenders; instead, the aliens are controlled by the game system itself, through an artificial intelligence system based on two types of cards:Alien cards, which define the behavior of each different alien and detail its skills and combat abilities.Close Encounter cards, which are used at the beginning of each alien turn to determine which aliens activate.The combination of a unique AI for each alien species and the uncertainty about alien activation in a turn provides a realistic simulation of the chaos of battle and a sophisticated challenge for the players. Since having more agents brings more alien activations for the aliens, the turn structure allows the level of difficulty to scale dynamically based on the number of agents in play. If agents die during the game, the system "recalibrates" the difficulty to a reasonable and enjoyable level, so you still have a chance to complete the mission.The battle for Earth will be carried out in a series of twelve missions organized in a completely story-driven campaign. Mission events influence future games in two different ways:Each mission has multiple endings, and the outcome of any mission will change the flow of the story.The agents gain experience during the missions. This experience transforms a good soldier into a perfect Galaxy Defender agent with multiple skills, basic and improved tactics, and the ability to use new devices, improved human weapons, and Alien technology.With the downloadable Galaxy Defenders: Alien Mind variant, you can transform the game into a competitive affair, with one player becoming the alien mastermind and controlling the alien army and the card in play, attempting to thwart each mission undertaken by the Agents. To do this, the alien player completes his own game objectives, obtaining new "alien signals" that can be teleported onto the battlefield. This variant, which allows for play with up to six players, can be used in a single mission or for a whole campaign ofGalaxy Defenders. Using Alien Mind may increase the game difficulty and is suggested only for expert players.</description>

<description>For a time, the humans of Sera knew peace...then Emergence Day came. The Locust horde arrived without warning, and countless horrors spilled forth from their underground burrows. The Coalition of Organized Governments (COG) struggled to fend off the subterranean threat, but their defenses were quickly crushed.

Now the long struggle against overwhelming odds approaches one final, desperate stand.Gears of War: The Board Game, designed by Corey Konieczka, is based on the wildly popular third-person shooter by Epic Games. One to four players take on the roles of COG soldiers cooperating to destroy the Locust horde, and must work together to complete missions against an ingeniously challenging and varied game system. InGears of War: The Board Game, you’ll relive classic moments fromGears of WarandGears of War 2– Roadie Run into cover, spray your enemy with blind fire, or rip him in half with your Lancer's chainsaw!InGears of War: The Board Gameyou must fulfill one of seven randomly constructed missions and support your fellow COGs as your team engages an unflinching enemy in furious, white-knuckle firefights! Only through teamwork and communication will you gain a tactical advantage, completing your mission and striking a blow for humanity.You'll need every soldier you can get if you hope to send the Locust horde back to their holes.

<description>The old clock tower is striking midnight! The three ghost hunters quickly reload their green goo ammunition in their handmade power pistols and enter the castle. Let the ghost hunt begin!Together inGhost Blaster, the players try to hit and trap the ghosts with the right amount of goo. Players must roll the dice in sequence and reveal the ghosts using the ghost hunter cards. Once the players have three of the same ghost cards face up, this ghost is caught and can no longer escape. But careful! If the players accidentally uncover a keyhole card, the ghost hunter is caught in the trap and must then go into the dungeon. Players can free him but that takes up valuable time! Their objective is to capture all of the ghosts before the ghost hour is over.</description>

<description>Ghost Stories is a cooperative game in which the players protect the village from incarnations of the lord of hell – Wu-Feng – and his legions of ghosts before they haunt a town and recover the ashes that will allow him to return to life. Each Player represents a Taoist monk working together with the others to fight off waves of ghosts.The players, using teamwork, will have to exorcise the ghosts which will appear during the course of the game. At the beginning of his turn, a player brings a ghost into play and places it on a free spot, and more than one can come in at the same time. The ghosts all have abilities of their own – some affecting the Taoists and their powers, some causing the active player to roll the curse die for a random effect, and others haunting the villager tiles and blocking that tile's special action. On his turn, a Taoist can move on a tile in order to exorcise adjacent ghosts or to benefit from the villager living on the tile, providing it is not haunted. Each tile of the village allows the players to benefit from a different bonus. With the cemetery, for example, Taoists can bring a dead Taoist back to life, while the herbalist allows to recover spent Tao tokens, etc. It will also be possible to get traps or move ghosts or unhaunt other village tiles.To exorcise a ghost, the Taoist rolls three Tao dice with different colors: red, blue, green, yellow, black, and white. If the result of the roll matches the color(s) of the ghost or incarnation of Wu-Feng, the exorcism succeeds. The white result is a wild color which can be used as any color. For example, to exorcise a green ghost with 3 resistance, you need to roll three green, three white, or a combination of both. If your die rolls fall short, you can also use Tao tokens that match the color in addition to your roll. You may choose to use these after your roll. Taoists gain these tokens by using certain village tiles or by exorcising certain ghosts. One of the Taoists has a power that allows him to receive such a token once per turn.To win, the players must defeat the incarnation of Wu-Feng, a boss who arrives at the end of the game. There are also harder difficulty levels that add more incarnations of Wu-Feng, in which to win, you must defeat all of them.There are many more ways to lose, however. The players lose if three of the village's tiles are haunted, if the draw pile is emptied while the incarnation of Wu-Feng is still in play, or if all the priests are dead.</description>

<description>Reach in the bag to find the puzzle pieces that fit your bedroom game board. Try to distinguish between the different puzzle pieces and decide which one feels like the size and shape of a piece you need. If you pull out a monster, don't be scared... You take charge, and the monsters will take off!Being afraid of monsters is a normal part of growing up. Go Away Monster! encourages kids to conquer that fear by acting it out and taking control. It also lets them experience some of the apprehension and excitement in deciding what is real and what is imaginary.</description>

<description>Guardians Chroniclesis a superhero-themed miniatures game in which you play as one of the members of the Liberty Patrol or as the group's archnemesis, Professor Skarov.To set up, the Skarov player arranges the nine double-sided game board tiles into a 3x3 grid, with his control room in the center space. Each player takes her character sheet, miniature and 7-10 action cards. These characters enter the grid on one of the side tiles and need to advance around the square – confronting minions and traps along the way – in order to achieve whatever objectives are in place for this game, such as thwarting a nuclear missile attack.Each turn, the hero players play 1-2 action cards; each card shows both a special power and modifiers to that hero's inherent statistics – movement, attack, defense and mental – and the played cards can be used for either the special power or the modifiers. Each hero player has four actions in a round, and the players can play in any order they wish; the actions are move across the base, attack an enemy, or use a special power on a played action card or the hero's character sheet.Professor Skarov then receives a number of action points based partially on the heroes' actions, and he uses these to activate himself, his minions, or his robots, with these figures also performing move, attack, or special power actions.As the players complete (or fail to complete) objectives, the newspapers report on who did what, and the sum of those reports determine who comes out on top.</description>

<description>HERO versus GUARDIAN: A Game of Dungeon Craft is a 2-4 player card- and dice-based strategy game that takes 45-90 minutes to play. The game has two distinct roles: the role of the Guardian who builds a dungeon and the role of the Hero who builds a party of adventurers to loot the dungeon built by the Guardian.At the start of the game the Guardian secretly designs a dungeon using a set of 16 room cards. Additional room cards are set aside and drawn from as the game progresses. There are 4 basic room types: Traps, Brutes, Evil and Magic. Brute and Evil rooms are more common and Magic and Trap rooms less common. Each room in the game is unique and has specific ways in which it can assist in the dungeon defense. For example, some rooms, like the RUST BEAST, destroy items, others, like the PRISON CELL, give the HERO player an addition adventurer if the room is captured by the HERO. In addition, there are empty rooms that when coupled with other rooms create a modifier to the chance of that room being overtaken. The Treasure Vault is the most valuable of those rooms and the goal is to keep the adventurers from finding and capturing it. Once the Guardian places entrances outside the dungeon, the game begins.Within a round, players spend tokens to take actions in an alternating sequence. The game combines elements of chance with your ability to read your opponent's strategy. The Guardian and Hero do not HAVE to take an action and can pass and wait to see what the other is doing, however, each round the Guardian has last option which means he or she can act last forcing the hero to either act, or end their turn and turn over all but 1 of their action tokens. In addition, the Hero has first option, meaning if both players wish to act first in a round, the Hero gets to go first.Each player has action tokens to spend on a variety of actions. Players use tokens to make plays during a round. After all players have spent their tokens, a new round begins with a new set of tokens.The Heroes use tokens to prepare adventurers, and move them through the dungeon. Actions include: scouting a room (a less lethal option but slower and thus can waste precious time), venturing a room (a potentially lethal action where the hero charges adventurers into a room), play a card (spell, item or adventurer), draw a card, retreat, or pass. Heroes earn points by defeating rooms. The Guardian uses action tokens to build more rooms into the dungeon, alter room locations in the dungeon, create dungeon effects to slow down the Hero's progress, or draw cards from the dungeon deck. Each card drawn brings the game closer to the end, because when the dungeon deck is emptied the game ends. The Guardian earns points by capturing adventurers and their gear, and by keeping his dungeon rooms from being captured. The game ends either when the Guardian has drawn all the dungeon cards or when the Hero captures the Treasure Vault.A major component of the game is how the Hero moves through the dungeon and captures rooms. The Hero must enter from one of the 2 entrances, and then must always move to rooms that are adjacent (not DIAGONAL) to the entrance, or adjacent to any cleared room connected to the entrance by other cleared rooms. To clear a room the Hero uses action tokens to form a party. Selecting between 1 and 4 of his adventurers with skills suited for the room at hand. The Hero can save time by charging into an unknown room or use action tokens to scout the room and then pick the best party for the job. The advantage of charging is that it saves time and throws off the Guardian, however, it can mean certain death. Scouting is safer, but eats precious time. The Hero is trying to put the best adventurers in the rooms most suited to their skills—while the Guardian tries to ambush and surprise the Hero with rooms that challenge the adventurers. This is where spells (for the Hero) and Dungeon Effects (for the Guardian) help tip the scales of a close combat. The 4 basic Adventurers WARRIOR, ROGUE, WIZARD, and CLERIC each have a room they are best at defeating. However, they are also capable and somewhat skilled in other rooms. In addition they each have a power which gives them strategic advantages, for example the warrior is better at venturing, the rogue at scouting, the wizard can cast spells without eating action points, and the cleric can save party members by sacrificing himself. Using their skills and talents at the right time in a well balanced group can mean the difference between a wipe-out and a victory. Of course, the Guardian can see the party composition and their equipment, but the Hero cannot see what is in the rooms. So the Guardian is constantly shifting and bolstering his rooms to create the most havoc for the party at hand.Equipment also scores points for the Guardian if captured, but is important to boost the adventurers skills vs. various rooms. It also takes time (action tokens) to equip. The advantage of the bonus vs. the consumption of time becomes a key strategic choice.In a multi-player game there are multiple Heroes who each take a turn in sequence against the Guardian. Each Hero builds a party of adventurers and equips them separately. In the end if the Heroes have more combined points they win as a team against the Guardian. The game currently can play 1 to 3 Heroes vs. 1 Guardian.</description>

<description>In the cooperative, press-your-luck game Hotshots, crews of 1 to 4 players take on the roles of wildfire fighters — crew boss, spotter, swamper, and sawyer — with special abilities, then roll dice on burning terrain tiles to match the combinations shown on those tiles. The more faces they roll, the better they fight the fire. Players can choose to cut firebreaks, which protect tiles from embers blown by wind gusts, or push their luck to reduce flames and possibly even generate reward tokens. If players bust and fail to match at least three of the six symbols on the tile, the fire grows. Another option is to maneuver vehicles — air tanker, helicopter, and brush rig — to save the forest.</description>

<description>If I'm Going Down...(orIIGD) is the first ever Dying Card Game (or DCG) from Van Ryder Games. A DCG is a card game in which it is certain that the character(s) WILL die. For 1 to 2 players (expandable to 3 to 4 with a 2nd copy),IIGDis set in a world overrun by zombies. Unlike virtually every other Zombie game, your goal is not to survive, but to kill as many zombies as possible before you die, which results in very engrossing solo or cooperative play.IIGDputs you smack in the middle of a hopeless scenario where endless zombies lurch and ramble toward you, never stopping until you are dead or become one of them (Zead). You must gather and use weapons and resources to take as many of the abominations as you can with you.Zombies enter the playing area from several "Entry" points depending on the scenario. You can take actions during your turn such as Attack, Use an Item, or Search for Resources. Each turn the Zombies will be moved closer and closer and eventually the resources will run out...Random events or "Occurrences" that come into play and change the rules keep the game fresh and different every time. The game may be played in a sort of "Kill em All" mode where you simply try to achieve the best score or you can play one of several Story Arcs that add entertaining story lines to the game where how well you do determines what happens in the story after you die.The unique mechanisms of the Fate Deck – which determines whether you find a resource when searching and whether you "hit" or "miss" during an attack – and the Tracker cards – which are used to keep track of health, ammo, and inventory – make this a game unlike any you have seen before.One other thing that makes this game unique in the Zombie genre is that each Zombie is illustrated with AMAZING detail and has a character all its own. You may just become more invested in the story of the Zombies than you are in the characters you play!IIGDallows for some level of creative control for players who have interest in making their own layouts and scenarios.</description>

<description>ION: A Compound Building Gameis a card drafting game where players select from a number of available Ion Cards and Noble Gas cards with the goal of creating sets of compounds and inert noble gases.Here’s how the game is played: Each player is dealt eight cards, must select one of those cards and then passes the remaining. Players must choose to either bond (pair) their selected card with another Element Card or set it alone (possibly to form an ionic bond at a later time). Throughout the game, players gain additional points for building specific compounds which are listed on the Compound Goal Cards and have available a set of Action Tiles which award them additional moves throughout the game. Players score points based upon the quantity and type of neutrally balanced compounds they construct and noble gas sets they collect. After three rounds, players add their total scores from each round, subtract points from Action Tiles used, and the player with the most points wins!</description>

<description>You're a team of lowly maintenance robots built to keep the space station operational and clean so that the colonists can get on with...whatever it is they do. Unfortunately, the station has been invaded by creeps, alien creatures that slowly advance toward food (the colonists) so that they can multiply. The only thing keeping the colonists from being completely wiped out is your knowledge of the station, a couple of specialty tools and abilities unique to each of you, and a little bit of problem-solving code installed so you could do your jobs efficiently.Jupiter Rescue is a co-operative strategy game in which players work together to escort 28 colonists to an escape pod before they're converted into alien creeps. Each turn, players may take five actions, choosing from common options — moving themselves, moving nearby colonists, or killing alien creeps — and a series of programming cards that grant them special abilities. These cards can be played on the player's turn to activate the ability. Each player also gets to choose one card to be his "core" ability, letting him use it every turn instead of discarding it.New creeps are added to the board, which is composed of tiles, at the end of each player's turn by rolling a die; if a tile fills up with creeps, it's destroyed and removed from the game. Players lose if enough colonists get turned into creeps, or if certain key board tiles are all destroyed. Double-sided tiles allow for hundreds of station variations.</description>

<description>Kings of Israelis a board game taking place in Israel (the Northern Kingdom) during the reign of its kings up until Israel's destruction by Assyria. Players are on a team, with each person representing a line of prophets that are trying to remove evil and idols from Israel, while building altars to help guide Israel in the upcoming difficult years. If the players are able to build enough altars before the game ends, they win. If the game ends by either the team running out of sin cubes or idols, or by Assyria destroying Israel, the prophets lose.A typical round has four phases:1. King's Godliness Phase: During this phase, if a bad king is reigning over Israel, the players must draw a Sin &amp;amp; Punishment card, which means bad things occur in Israel because of evil or in response to evil. If during the reign of a good king, the starting player receives a Blessing card.2. Sin Increases Phase: Location cards are drawn and sin increases at each revealed location. This can possibly cause idols to appear or sin to spread further if sin increases at a location with an idol.3. Prophets Work Phase: In this phase each prophet gets to use four actions to accomplish their goals. They may use their actions to move, remove sin or idols, draw resource cards, build an altar, make a sacrifice at an altar, or to give resources to another player. A prophets may also play Blessing cards at this time if they have them. In expert mode, after all the prophets take their turn, the false prophet takes his turn.4. End of Round Phase: The starting player changes to the next player and the timeline token moves down to the next king chronologically. In easy mode, any player who had made a sacrifice that turn then draws a single Blessing card.The family version ofKings of Israelis available on the game's website. This version eliminates the King's Godliness phase, Abilities, and the Blessing cards, which makes for an easier, quicker, and more simplified game.</description>

<description>Note: This game is in German.  One of 2014 Kinderspielexperten "5-to-9-year-olds" Nominee.It's a race for the treasure inKoboldbande, with the player kobolds working together to create a path to the treasure before the dragon can get its talons into the chest first.Before the game begins, players seed the 6x8 game board with four keys and a candy tile by rolling two dice — one color, and another symbol — and placing the tiles on the appropriate locations on the game board. Shuffle the 27 path tiles and 10 dragon tiles together.On a turn, a player draws a tile. If it's a dragon tile, she places it on the first empty space on the dragon path; if a path tile, she places it at the end of a path already on the board. (The first path tile is placed in the upper-left square of the game board, while the treasure is below the lower-right square.) If the path is placed on a key, the players claim the key. If the path crosses the candies, the players can place one dragon tile on the candies, delaying the dragon on its way to the treasure.Once the players have collected three keys, they can then lay a tile on the treasure chest — and if they reach the treasure before the dragon does, they win!</description>

<description>A children's game for 2 or more players,ages 4 and up.In turn, each player spins the spinner on the board. If the spinner points to one of the eight ladybugs, the player may move that ladybug to visit the other ladybugs. Each ladybug piece has a magnet in its nose; if the visiting ladybug "likes" the ladybug, they may swap spots (each ladybug has five spots of one color), and she continues on to visit other ladybugs. If the ladybugs do not like each other, the turn is over. Once a ladybug has five spots of different colors, she is ready for the ball and taken out of play. The players win if all of the ladybugs are ready.But if the spinner points to one of the smaller leaves, then the player doesn't get to move any ladybugs, but instead must advance the ants along the side of the board. If all seven of the ants are on board (and each takes two moves to get on-board), the players lose the game.English title: The Ladybug's Costume Party. Rules provided in German, English, French, Dutch, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese.</description>

<description>Legendary: A Marvel Deck Building Game is set in the Marvel Comics universe. To set up the game, players choose a number of hero decks – Spider-Man, Hulk, Cyclops, Wolverine, etc. – and shuffle them together; since players use only a handful of hero decks out of the fifteen included, the hero deck can vary widely in terms of what's available. Players then choose a mastermind villain (Magneto, Loki, Dr. Doom, etc.), stack that particular villain's attack cards underneath it, then modify the villain deck as needed based on that villain's particular scheme.Over the course of the game, players will recruit powerful hero cards to add to their deck in order to build a stronger and more resourceful deck. Players need to build both their recruitment powers (to enlist more heroes) and their fighting ability (to combat the villains who keep popping up to cause trouble). Players recruit heroes from an array of six cards, with empty slots refilled as needed. At the start of a player's turn, he reveals a villain and adds it to the row of villains. This row has a limited number of spaces, and if it fills up, the earliest villain to arrive escapes, possibly punishing the heroes in some way. Some villains also take an action when showing up for the first time, such as kidnapping an innocent bystander. The villain deck also contains "master strike" cards, and whenever one of these shows up, the mastermind villain (controlled by the game) takes a bonus action.As players fight and defeat villains, they collect those cards, which will be worth points at game's end. Players can also fight the mastermind; if a player has enough fighting power, he claims one of the attack cards beneath the mastermind, which has a particular effect on the game. If all of these cards are claimed, the game ends and players tally their points to see who wins. If the mastermind completes his scheme, however – having a certain number of villains escape, for example, or imposing a certain number of wounds on the heroes – then the players all lose.</description>

<description>Legends of Andor is a cooperative adventure board game for two to four players in which a band of heroes must work together to defend a fantasy realm from invading hordes. To secure Andor's borders, the heroes will embark on dangerous quests over the course of five unique scenarios (as well as a final scenario created by the players themselves). But as the clever game system keeps monsters on the march toward the castle, the players must balance their priorities carefully.At the heart of Legends of Andor is its unique narrative, the linked scenarios of which tell an overarching story as the players successfully complete objectives. For each scenario, or "Legend", a legend deck conveys the plot of an ever-unfolding tale...one in which the players are the protagonists. A wooden marker moves along the board's legend track at key points during each scenario, triggering the draw of a new legend card, the introduction of new game-altering effects, and the advancement of the story's plot. In the end, the players must endeavor to guide the fate of Andor through their heroic actions, bringing a happy ending to their epic fantasy tale.Will their heroes roam the land completing quests in the name of glory, or devote themselves to the defense of the realm? Uncover epic tales of glory as you live the Legends of Andor!</description>

<description>It's the dawn of the Livonian Crusade, and Estonia is being conquered by several nations. The Danish forces of Valdemar the Great are arriving from the West. The Crusaders, led by Bishop Albert, are crossing the borders from the South. Vsevolod, Prince of Novgorod, is attacking from the East. There's only one hope for Estonians: Lembitu, the leader, who is brave enough to fight against all the conquerors.Lembituis a co-operative board game inspired by the events of the Livonian Crusade in Estonia. Players are in the role of generals, fighting against conquerers and initiating rebellions. Actions can be used for movement, fighting or uprisings — but as each player has only a limited number of actions, they must plan carefully. The direction and speed of enemy movement is decided by dice, but the enemy's ultimate goal is to reach Paide. If they don't reach it within a fixed amount of turns, the players win.</description>

<description>Leo the lion's mane is far too long and he risks looking shaggy and losing the respect of his fellow animals — but those same animals keep stopping him to chit-chat while on the way to a haircut. Can you get this king of the jungle to the barber shop in time?InLeo, players need to help Leo reach the barber shop before it closes for the day. To set up, place all of the animal tiles face down, shuffle them, then create a track that leads from Leo's bed to Bobo's Barber Shop. Set the clock to 8:00 a.m. Each player starts a number of cards in hand.On a turn, a player plays one card to move Leo ahead 1-4 spaces on the track, then reveals the animal tile on which Leo landed. If the tile is the same color as the card just played, the clock remains at the same time as it was at the start of the turn; if the tile has a different color, however, the clock moves ahead 1-5 hours depending on the animal depicted. Poor Leo! If the clock reaches 8:00 p.m. before Leo arrives at the barber shop, the round ends and Leo must return home in order to try again the next day. Turn all face-up tiles face down again.If the players manage to get Leo to the barber shop within five days to get him a trim, they win!</description>

<description>The year is 2020. The world hovers on the brink of annihilation. Preceded by a devastating orbital attack, a warlike alien race known as the Hydra has besieged the planet, their invasion force carried on enormous drop ships that dwarf city blocks and rain devastation from above. The Hydra’s ultimate goal is to eradicate the last survivors of their ancient nemesis, the Ghin, an alien race that has taken refuge on Earth. Humanity is caught in the apocalyptic crossfire. As widespread panic grips the populace, governments topple, economies crumble, and order dissolves. In these desperate days, mankind’s only hope lies with the Ghin and one of their most brilliant minds: Dr. Cronos, a being as guilty of atrocities against humanity as those who hunt him.LEVEL 7 [INVASION]is a standalone semi-cooperative game of global strategy set in the LEVEL 7 universe that follows the events ofLEVEL 7 [ESCAPE],LEVEL 7 [ESCAPE]: Lockdown, andLEVEL 7 [OMEGA PROTOCOL]. As the planet is battered by the Hydra's relentless assault, you'll control Earth's desperation-forged coalitions in an effort to turn back the invasion. But soldiers aren't enough. You and your allies must manage your resources carefully to combat the threats of hysteria, famine, and population loss as well. Endure long enough, and you might buy the time for Dr. Cronos to develop the advanced weaponry required to defeat the invading Hydra. The survival of the human race depends on your next move!</description>

<description>A children's game for 2 or more players,ages 4 and up.In turn, each player spins the spinner on the board. If the spinner points to one of the eight ladybugs, the player may move that ladybug to visit the other ladybugs. Each ladybug piece has a magnet in its nose; if the visiting ladybug "likes" the ladybug, they may swap spots (each ladybug has five spots of one color), and she continues on to visit other ladybugs. If the ladybugs do not like each other, the turn is over. Once a ladybug has five spots of different colors, she is ready for the ball and taken out of play. The players win if all of the ladybugs are ready.But if the spinner points to one of the smaller leaves, then the player doesn't get to move any ladybugs, but instead must advance the ants along the side of the board. If all seven of the ants are on board (and each takes two moves to get on-board), the players lose the game.English title: The Ladybug's Costume Party. Rules provided in German, English, French, Dutch, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese.</description>

<description>Mysteriumis a purely co-operative game for 2-7 players. One player takes the role of a helpful ghost who lives in a mysterious ancient manor. Other players are a group of psychics invited by the manor owner to solve the mystery of the place and bring peace to its residents, as any person who stays in the castle sees strange dreams.The ancient legend says the ghost is the soul of the manor's previous resident, who was unjustly executed for a crime he didn't commit, more than 100 years ago. Now he tries to use the mysterious signs to tell people the truth about what really happened then, so that justice would be established and he might rest in peace for ever. The specialists in the supernatural were invited to try to understand what the ghost wants to tell and in case of success be honoured by one more victory and receive a generous reward. They have 7 days and 7 nights to reach their goal. If they succeed in time, everyone wins the game (including the ghost).</description>

<description>Mysterium: Secrets &amp;amp; Lies consists of six new characters, six new locations, six new items, and 18 story cards. This latter group of cards can replace the object cards in the game, with each card representing one way in which the ghost died. Now instead of trying to get each investigator to identify an object — a singular item that wouldn't have much nuance to it — the ghost must instead use the dream cards to convey the story of their demise, something far more challenging.</description>

<description>Myth is a fully co-operative fantasy game. Players take on the role of one of 5 different heroes working together to defeat the Darkness. Each hero has a different skill set which represented by a unique deck of cards. Players spend Action Points by using cards. Once a certain amount of Action Points have been spent the Darkness fights back by activating monster lairs, spawning monster captains and eventually the Boss.A complete game in Myth is called a Story. Each Story is played over three Acts. Acts can be played sequentially, or can be split up over three different game sessions.Players' avatars within a Story are called Heroes. Myth Heroes are clothed in immense power, able to reave all but the mightiest foes. However, this power must be balanced lest the Darkness take too much notice. Players must weigh their actions against the Threat each will bring, with the consequences of awakening more evil and bringing doom on the party's endeavors. And be careful they must, as the Darkness is formidable and eager to snatch glory from the valiant.Heroes are controlled through an intuitive Hero Deck (videos for each Hero can be found in the Game Play Videos section below). Each deck plays uniquely and allows players more freedom of action and the ability to truly impact the Story each and every Act. Yet, cooperation is the key to victory and bloody fortune. Players must communicate, interact, and assist each other or surely the Darkness will cover all.Myth is a fully cooperative game. There is no player controlling the Darkness. The Darkness is governed by a set of rules unique to each Boss Deck and is activated through Hero actions. If the Heroes get overzealous, then the Darkness pushes back by activating Lairs, spawning Captains, and punishing the Heroes with devious Events. If the Heroes take a more subtle approach, then the Darkness reacts by reducing the potential for treasure and rewards. Without the treasures and equipment to upgrade, the Heroes will find each Act more difficult and eventually fail. The dynamic nature of the Darkness really lends a more fluid feel to the Story. Players aren't being driven by properties out of their control, nor are they being shepherded by a person whose skill has a direct impact on the enjoyment of the game.</description>

Each card is sleeved, and within the sleeve on its back is a rule explaining how this card can be swapped with another card: swap it with a red card, a card with an even number, a card with a higher number, and so on. You can look at all the rules on cards in front of you, but you cannot communicate to others what those rules are. You cannot change the order of cards in front of you.</description>

<description>One Deck Dungeon is a card game "roguelike" — a dungeon delve that is different every time, difficult to survive, with a character you build up from scratch. The deck consists of various monsters, traps, and other encounters from the dungeon. Each card, though, depicts both the obstacle to overcome and the potential rewards for doing so. When you defeat a card, you claim it as either treasure, an item, or a skill, tucking it under the appropriate side of your character card to show its benefits.</description>

When you defeat a card, you claim it as either experience, an item, or a skill, tucking it under the appropriate side of your character card to show its benefits. The longer you take exploring the dungeon, the deeper you'll delve, and the difficulty will scale up quickly! If you make it far enough, you'll have to fight the dungeon boss.

<description>You are a Dreamwalker, lost in a mysterious labyrinth, and you must discover the oneiric doors before your dreamtime runs out – or you will remain trapped forever!You may wander through the chambers of dreams, hoping that chance will reveal the doors, or you can linger in each type of room. In both cases, you will have to deal with the slithering Nightmares, which haunt the hallways of the labyrinth.Onirimis a solo/cooperative card game. You (and a partner, if you wish) must work (together) against the game to gather the eight Door cards before the deck runs out; you can obtain those Door cards either by playing cards of the same color three turns in a row, or by discarding (under specific circumstances) one of your powerful Key cards. In both cases you will have to decide the best use of each card in your hand and carefully play around the Nightmares. Those cards are hidden in the deck and will trigger painful dilemmas when drawn...Seven mini-expansions, all standalone and compatible with one another, are included with the second edition ofOnirim, including these three that were in the first edition of the game:"The Towers" introduces a new type of card that allows more searching and deck manipulation, while also imposing an additional victory condition."Happy Dreams and Dark Premonitions" adds evil time bombs that will impede your progress at predictable moments of your quest as well as helpful but unreliable allies.In "The Book of Steps Lost and Found", you must find the eight Door cards in a randomly given order and may remove discarded cards from the game to cast powerful spells that will help you complete this difficult task.</description>

<description>Welcome to Outpost 1, the first science observatory located in the isolated frozen tundra of Siberia! You and your team have been investigating anomalous activities the region, and recently things have shifted for the worse. The coming storm is said to be the "storm-of-the-century"; it may last a month or more. Strange howls and buzzing fill the long nights, and yesterday a crew-member went AWOL... or worse. The call for evacuation was made, but it came too late. The long winter storm has set in. There's no hope of getting help until it clears. Now your crew's only hope is to use what little resources you have to survive the long winter cold (and whatever's out there in it). Use your rations wisely, and you may see the sun again.</description>

<description>In Pandemic, several virulent diseases have broken out simultaneously all over the world! The players are disease-fighting specialists whose mission is to treat disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.The game board depicts several major population centers on Earth. On each turn, a player can use up to four actions to travel between cities, treat infected populaces, discover a cure, or build a research station. A deck of cards provides the players with these abilities, but sprinkled throughout this deck are Epidemic! cards that accelerate and intensify the diseases' activity. A second, separate deck of cards controls the "normal" spread of the infections.Taking a unique role within the team, players must plan their strategy to mesh with their specialists' strengths in order to conquer the diseases. For example, the Operations Expert can build research stations which are needed to find cures for the diseases and which allow for greater mobility between cities; the Scientist needs only four cards of a particular disease to cure it instead of the normal five—but the diseases are spreading quickly and time is running out. If one or more diseases spreads beyond recovery or if too much time elapses, the players all lose. If they cure the four diseases, they all win!The 2013 edition of Pandemic includes two new characters—the Contingency Planner and the Quarantine Specialist—not available in earlier editions of the game.</description>

<description>ETA: Oct 20th, 2014After many years of trying to defeat the diseases that threaten mankind’s existence, the tables have been turned. You are now the disease and guess what? There is no cure.InPandemic: Contagion, you are competing against other diseases (fellow players) to see who can eliminate humanity. With no cure to be had, the one of you that wipes out all human civilization will come out on top as the most deadly disease ever known to man, may he rest in peace.Pandemic: Contagionincludes a deck of contagion cards with differing colored borders, city cards with similar colored borders, event/WHO cards, player disease card and disease cubes. On a turn you take two of three possible actions, and you can take the same action twice. Those actions are:Draw contagion cards equal to your current incubation rate.Advance one of three mutations to the next level.Spread disease equal to your current transmission rate.When the number of diseases equals the city’s population number, the city is wiped out. The player who placed the final disease earns a special action. The player with the most diseases scores the population number. The two smaller numbers are awarded to those with the second- and third-most diseases.Your disease card has three mutations: Incubation (number of cards you can draw), Transmission (number of disease cubes you can spread), and Resistance (number of cubes/cards you can protect). As an action, you can advance a mutation one level by discarding the required number of cards.Event cards are drawn at the start of each round and affect everyone during their turn. You might benefit from the card or it could have a negative impact. WHO cards are always bad, but your resistance will lessen whatever the penalty would be based on its level, if you planned ahead.Mid-game scoring occurs when the second, fourth and sixth skull comes out. When a city icon appears, a new city is introduced.Once the event/WHO deck runs out or only two city cards remain in play, the game ends, with players conducting a final scoring round to see which virus is victorious. </description>

<description>At the height of its power, the Roman Empire held more than two million square miles of territory containing over a hundred million people. Throughout the centuries of its existence, the Empire brought major advancements in engineering, architecture, science, art, and literature. By the beginning of the 5th Century, decades of political corruption, economic crisis, and an overburdened military had exacted a severe toll on the stability of the Empire. This paved the way for severe incursions from aggressive barbarian tribes, leading to a decline from which Rome would not recover. Now citizens, soldiers, and allies of Rome must unite to protect the Empire.</description>

<description>Note: This is not a standalone product and you'll need both the base game Pandemic and Pandemic: On The Brink to play.In Pandemic: In the Lab, the second expansion for Pandemic, you will use a new game board that allows you to move the pawns in a laboratory. The goal of this activity is the same as in the base game – finding cures for diseases – but this time in a new way. Behind sealed bio-hazard doors, scientists race against time to sequence diseases, take samples, and test cures.Pandemic: In the Lab includes four new roles, new Virulent Strain events, and a Worldwide Panic Mutation scenario. Players can compete individually or on rival teams (when playing with four or six players). Can your team work together in the lab to save humanity?</description>

<description>Pandemic: The Cure, a dice-based version of the popularPandemicboard game, sets up in less than a minute and plays in 30 minutes. As in the board game, four diseases threaten the world and it's up to your team to save humanity. You and your team must keep the world's hotspots in check before they break out of control, while researching cures to the four plagues.Players roll dice each turn to determine the actions available to them. They can fly and sail between the six major population centers of the world, treat disease in their current region, collect samples for further study, and exchange knowledge to help them in their goal of discovering cures. Each player takes on a different role that has its own unique set of dice and abilities — and players must take advantage of their specializations if they are to have any hope of winning the game. The Dispatcher, for example, can spend dice to fly others around the board, while the Medic is particularly adept at treating disease. Players can roll their dice as often as they like, but the more times they re-roll for the perfect turn, the more likely the next epidemic will occur.At the end of each turn, new "infection dice" are rolled to determine the type and location of newly infected populations. If any region on the board is infected with more than three dice of a given color, an outbreak occurs, spreading disease into an adjacent region. If too many outbreaks take place, too many people get infected, or the rate of infection gets too high, all the players lose. If, however, the players can discover the cures to the four diseases, they all win and humanity is saved!</description>

<description>Some old habits die hard. As the city is unexpectedly hit by disaster, and its inhabitants are slowly turning into hordes of hungry undead, an ever-growing assembly of zombies is beginning to queue outside a little corner pub. Inside a small group of patrons suddenly becomes aware that the evening is going to be more than just beer and snacks, and they're forced to take up whatever arms are within reach to avoid the fate of ending up as someone else's snack.InPints of Blood, you must keep the zombies from entering the pub, and they're outside ready to move forward whenever they see any sign of life at the windows or door – or if they're pushed from behind by the ever-increasing number of zombies that are being brought in by the still running public transport.But no need to despair as help is on its way! Rally with your fellow survivors and hold out until the rescue vehicle makes its appearance. Be aware, however, that it might not have room for everyone, so at some point you may have to decide whether to support your mates or to fight for yourself — but if all buddies die before help arrives, the zombies win.</description>

<description>Police Precinct is a cooperative/semi-cooperative game where players are tasked with solving a mysterious murder while simultaneously working to keep crime on the streets under control, and to keep the city from falling into chaos.Players take on the role of police officers with different areas of expertise. The players work together to solve the mystery by collecting evidence and eventually arresting the suspect.Complicating matters is the fact that there may or may not be a corrupt officer that is being paid off by the murderer to suppress evidence, the same evidence everyone else is trying to uncover.Players move around the city searching through randomly shuffled investigation cards for evidence in relation to the murder. The number of investigation cards drawn depends on the character’s rating as well as how many player cards are added by other players to boost the character’s rating for the current “search”. There are four decks of investigation cards (Interview Witness, Collect Crime Scene Evidence, Examine Body and Locate Murder Weapon) to be searched. These decks are shuffled and placed in different locations. So, a player might search the cards in one area and not find any evidence at all… or maybe the bribed cop, if there is one, did the searching and just said no evidence was found.Players have to find all of the evidence cards from the investigation decks to be able to arrest the murderer.At the end of each player’s turn they draw an event card. These cards represent growing crime and emergencies that are happening in the city. Each one piles on top of the other, and if the cops don't stay on top of things, they will be buried in crime! These Event cards are placed on the game board at the locations where they occur. Some of them have “unknown circumstance” tokens placed face-down upon them, adding even more tension.If too many criminals are located in one area, a gang is formed. Each gang has its own power and can cripple the police efforts if not handled quickly and carefully.So, not only are the players investigating the murder, but they must also arrest street criminals and handle emergencies.Sometimes when a character successfully completes a task, that character is rewarded with a doughnut token. These tokens can later be used to help with tasks. However, if the character does not complete the task in time, the city crime track advances. The track can also advance if street crimes grow so large that no more street criminals can be placed, when called for. If the Crime Track advances to the end, the murderer escapes justice and the good cops fail the game.To add to the tension even further, The good cops only have so many days to complete the investigation. If time runs out, once again the murderer shall escape justice!The pressure is great and the stakes are high!</description>

Your team has been charged with confiscating these items and returning them to their proper locations in time, so you now need to infiltrate the mansion and abscond with four items before Prof. Evil can secrete four of them in locations inaccessible to you. Thankfully the old soul is a bit daft and won't evaporate you should he catch you lurking through the mansion, but simply scoot you out the front door where he'll forget about you immediately.</description>

<description>Raxxon is a 1-4 player cooperative card game set in the Dead of Winter universe at the start of the zombie apocalypse. Players each choose one of six different specialists assisting Raxxon with the evacuation of healthy citizens from among the sick. Citizens take the form of face-down square cards in a grid. Through game actions, these can be flipped to reveal whether they are sick or healthy. There are various types of sick and healthy cards, each triggering different effects when flipped or killed. Flip too many Chaotic sick and you'll add more citizens to the crowd, or even end the round prematurely. Killing off the healthy can have similar negative effects.</description>

<description>Red November is a cooperative game in a gnomish attack submarine where everything is going wrong. The sub is descending and the water pressure increasing, the nuclear reactor is overheating, the nuclear missile launchers are pre-igniting, fires and water leaks are everywhere, there's a giant Kraken looming nearby and there’s very little oxygen and vodka left. While the storyline feels more and more like a disaster movie, the players must get organized to solve the problems, divide the tasks among themselves to minimize the risks, and sometimes accept to sacrifice themselves for the common cause.The game is played on the map of the submarine. The conditions in the submarine are represented by three disaster tracks: Asphyxiation, Heat and Pressure. During the game, these conditions get worse, and if anyone of them reaches its maximum value, the submarine is lost. In addition, various emergencies can occur which have to be dealt with swiftly, or they'll also lead to the loss of the submarine.Each turn, a player can move to a new location, and perform some action there. Such an action can be repairs (which will improve conditions on the sub and/or fix emergencies), removing obstacles (unblocking hatches, removing flooding or extinguishing fires) or stocking up on equipment (which will help with later actions). Each action is paid for with time. The more time a player spends on an action, the greater the chance of success. After each player's turn, a number of events will happen; the more time was spent, the more events will occur. Such events will be the worsening of conditions in the submarine, or the triggering of emergencies.</description>

<description>In Red Peak, the players are daring adventurers who have discovered a new volcanic island — but then "Red Peak" on the north of the island decides to live up to its name and starts rumbling. An eruption seems imminent! Salvation is possibly only by returning to the beach as quickly as possible where — fingers crossed — a boat awaits the group. Players will be fighting using every means possible to make their way through the jungle, with the lava ready to spill onto their necks at any moment. Will the group reach the boat in time before lava engulfs their camp on the beach?</description>

<description>Story: An evil king has burned all fairy tale books. Only one is left, and its sheets have been shredded and scattered in an enchanted garden. Now the players must hurry and find the matching pieces, and leave the garden with them, before the king returns.Play: At any time, three book tiles are visible, the others are hidden below garden tiles. The player in turn may move up to two garden tiles (or rows of tiles). If there are two matching fairy tale pages visible after this move, he can collect this tale. If he doesn't find a match, the king moves one step. In addition, the player can move his pawn to an adjacent garden tile, or out of the garden if at the gate (but in this case, he can't collect any more tales).Goal: The players must find as many tales as possible (preferably all), and leave the garden. If the king finishes his track, and there are still players left in the garden, all players lose.Ages 5 and up.</description>

<description>Rick and Morty: Total Rickall Card Gameis based on theRick and Mortyepisode of the same name. If you haven't seen it, don't worry. You can still play this wild and wacky game and have plenty of fun — but you really should see it at some point. Seriously. Don't be a Jerry.Rick has locked the family inside their house. Why? Because the family has grown. Parasites masquerading as family and close friends have infiltrated and have inserted pleasant memories into everyone's minds to make them think they're real — and more keep coming! You must figure out which of these new, zany characters are real and which ones are parasites that need to be exterminated. Think you've got what it takes to save the world?The game features a basic fully cooperative mode and an advanced mode, where there are two teams.In the advanced mode, players will be dealt a hidden role as either Real or a Parasite. The Parasite players must try to keep at least one parasite alive in the end (keeping yourself alive is the easiest way to do this). The Real players must root out the Parasites to win.Now you can shoot the other players! But if you accidentally shoot a Real player, there are consequences...There is no player elimination, however. A player's secret identity might change, though.</description>

<description>Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island is a game created by Ignacy Trzewiczek, the author of Stronghold. This time Trzewiczek takes the players to a deserted island, where they'll play the parts of shipwreck survivors confronted by an extraordinary adventure. They'll be faced with the challenges of building a shelter, finding food, fighting wild beasts, and protecting themselves from weather changes. Building walls around their homes, animal domestication, constructing weapons and tools from what they find and much more awaits them on the island. The players decide in which direction the game will unfold and – after several in-game weeks of hard work – how their settlement will look. Will they manage to discover the secret of the island in the meantime? Will they find a pirate treasure, or an abandoned village? Will they discover an underground city or a cursed temple at the bottom of a volcano? Answers to these questions lie in hundreds of event cards and hundreds of object and structure cards that can be used during the game...</description>

<description>Trapped in a prison in which each room has four doors but apparently no exit, the players must try to find Room 25, the supposed exit to this nightmare. But some amongst them might be guardians of the prison, waiting for the right moment to strike. In the cooperative game Room 25, not everyone wants to escape from imprisonment – but who is the traitor? Each turn, the player moves are preprogrammed, requiring discussion, negotiation – and possibly betrayal.Room 25 includes five different playing modes, from full cooperation to a solitaire game.</description>

<description>Here's a game that's enormous fun and will sharpen your wits and hone your imagination. The 54 images were designed by Rory O'Connor of Ireland, a trainer in creativity and creative problem-solving. They can be used to arrive at answers or decisions in an indirect and ingenious way.Originally Rory had put the images on the faces of a Rubik's Cube, and players would turn the Cube to scramble the images, then choose one side to play with. Kate Jones of Kadon Enterprises suggested putting the 54 images on 9 separate cubes, to allow for quicker ways to generate more varied combinations, including conceptual puzzles. Rory readily agreed, having considered the 9-cubes idea himself earlier. At a creativity conference held at Kadon headquarters in May 2004, a prototype was whipped up, and in 2005 Kadon launched the cubes version of Rory's Story Cubes.Each jumbo 1" cube has 6 images or icons, with a total of 54 all-different hand-inlaid images that can be mixed in over 10 million ways. You roll all 9 cubes to generate 9 random images and then use these to invent a story that starts with "Once upon time..." and uses all 9 elements as part of your narrative.Play it as a game for one or more players, or as a party game for three or more. Or play it as an improv game where each player contributes part of the story, picking up where the last one left off. Win award points for speedy delivery, inventiveness, imagination, drama and humor.Full instructions include several other ways to use the cubes to solve problems, break up writer's block, enhance your imagination and heighten your ability to find unifying themes among the diverse images. Interpret or get at the meanings of your answers more quickly. It's fun, easy, and mind-stretching.As a puzzle the cubes will really give your imagination a work-out. You'll practically feel both sides of your brain dancing. The challenge: Fit the 9 cubes into a 3x3 square. Now examine the cubes in any one row and turn them so their tops have something in common. Do this for all 3 rows. Explain your choices, or challenge another player to identify the element they share. More than one answer may be right, and there are thousands of possible combinations.Rory's Story Cubes are recommended for all ages over 8, though it's fun to watch a younger child create combinations with the cubes and make up stories.</description>

<description>A few samurai warriors are sitting at a table in a small inn, talking and bragging about swords, women and honor. Sake flows freely, but not even the cellars of Bishamon, the God of War, could quench the thirst of Japan's greatest swordsmen. Servants run for cover, knowing full well where all this is going. Suddenly an eerie silence fills the common room. On the table, only one full cup remains. Who will get the last drink? Will it be the elder of the group, or shall the greatest warrior have it? Time seems to stretch to infinity, until one hand makes a move toward the cup. Such insolence! This insult shall not be tolerated! The elder goes for his sword...We shall never know whether the bold samurai was taking the cup for himself or only to hand it to his venerable companion. It does not matter: all warriors take offense and draw their katanas, joining the fight at the call of "SAAKEEE!"In Sake &amp;amp; Samurai you are a fierce and thirsty samurai warrior, willing to do anything to get the last cup of Sake. The winner is the most drunk samurai – in game terms, the player who has collected the most Sake drink counters – at the end of the Sudden Death round.Be wary, though, for drinking too much will dull your wits and mastery with the sword. Each drink of Sake prevents you from using one of your resources, be it a weapon, an item, or even your personal skill! You must always be wary not to drink too much or you risk becoming a defenseless sot in the hands of your enemies. On the other hand, you will be able to burn up some of the Sake you have drunk to obtain significant bonuses which may well save your life. Show yourself as the wise warrior you are and balance your strategy with care, not burning up too much Sake, thus finding yourself in the rear at the end of the game, when the Masu is empty and the Sudden death round begins. Those who will succumb to their enemies' blows won't be eliminated from the game, but will become Spirits of Enma, the thirsty god of death, and team up with the other Spirits to attack the living, aiming to steal their Sake. Raise your glasses (and your katanas)!</description>

Adapting to their environment they use land sails with wheels on these flats.

<description>InSalvation Road, the players control 4 to 8 characters struggling to survive in a barren wasteland.A set of Heroes, exceptional individuals, are holed up in a barricaded Compound, protecting a group of young, old, and wounded Survivors. The desert around them is filled with the shattered husks of buildings, and with marauding gangs of bandits. The Survivors are doing their best to keep the Marauders at bay. Some have even been recruited by the heroes to help search through this wasteland, scavenging Resources.The good news is that they've heard radio broadcasts from a settlement called Salvation, which claims to be a safe haven with plenty of food and water. The Characters need to save up enough Resources to make the long journey down the dangerous highway, in hopes of reaching safety from the Marauders.Can they survive long enough to get themselves, and the people under their protection, to Salvation?Salvation Roadis a co-operative game for 1 to 4 (up to 8 with a Scenario) players that plays in about an hour. In the standard game players are assigned 2 Characters (1 Hero and 1 Survivor). Both Characters are useful but you must deal with the Survivor's limitations and exploit the Hero's strengths to succeed. While scavenging resources in a post apocalyptic wasteland may sound easy, try doing it with the marauders on your tail, wounding you every chance they get.  </description>

<description>You awaken in a cold, dark and dreary room. You know, somehow, that you're in a sanitarium, but you don't know why you know, or how you got here. All you want to do is escape. Dark hallways extend in all directions, and the shadows themselves seem to swirl and twist menacingly. Fear and confusion grips you, but before you succumb to insanity, a memory returns. Safe things...things that you need...things that will make you whole, and let you escape. They are what you need to find, what you must find...Sanitarium is a card-driven horror escape game. At the start of the game, each player is dealt three to six (of 13, depending on the number of players) 'Safe Things' cards. Finding those specific items will allow escape from the Sanitarium.The cards form the map of the winding hallways, items scattered all over. Players must explore the layout (which will differ with each play) to find items that provide them useful powers, and also their Safe Things. Dark Hallways within the Sanitarium will spawn shadows, which will in turn chase the players. Getting caught by a shadow might earn you a hallucination. Hallucinations...are bad.The enemy of the players is time. The deck of item and event cards is the timer for the game -- when it runs out, everyone still inside succumbs to their madness!Sanitarium is fast-paced and easy to learn. It plays in 30-45 minutes. Coop, competitive, and solo scenarios are all provided.</description>

<description>Note: This game is in GermanIn the cooperative deduction game Schnappt Hubi!, which uses an electronic device similar to the one in Wer war's?, the players explore an old house by building a 3D-labyrinth of "broken" walls in the first phase and chasing a ghost in the second.Each player starts with his figure – a red or yellow mouse or blue or green hare – in one predetermined corner of the square house, which features a 4x4 grid of rooms that lacks any walls at the start of the game. The players find out which kind of walls are in certain directions by pressing one of four "arrow buttons" of a "compass" device with a built-in AI (to ensure that each game will have a different house). Walls come in four types: One that allows all animals to pass through, one with a mousehole that allows only mice through, one with a hole in the top that only hares can jump through, and one that's solid and impassable. The players build those walls, creating step-by-step a 3D-labyrinth. The goal of this first phase is to find the "magic doors", which can be opened only if there is an animal on each side.Once the players find the magic doors, the ghost "Hubi" appears. The device gives hints to the players, allowing them to deduce where Hubi is so that ideally they can eventually chase it out of the house.Schnappt Hubi! includes three difficulty levels, with a "timer" running in the hardest level that ends the game after a certain number of moves.</description>

<description>A mad scientist holds the world hostage with his terrifying inventions. An alien warlord from a far away galaxy brings his limitless army of bizarre minions to conquer the planet. A giant rampaging robot cuts a swath of destruction across the coast, destroying major population centers. And who will stand in their way? A team of heroes, all with impressive powers and abilities stand between the world and the forces of evil. Will you help them? Answer the call to protect the multiverse!Sentinels of the Multiverse is a cooperative, fixed-deck card game with a comic book flavor. Each player plays as one of ten heroes, against one of four villains, and the battle takes place in one of four different dynamic environments.Each player, after selecting one of the heroes, plays a deck of 40 cards against the villain and environment decks, which "play themselves", requiring the players to put the top card of the appropriate deck into play on the villain and environment turns. On each player's turn, they may play a card from their hand, use a power printed on one of their cards in play, and draw a card from their deck. Each round starts with the villain turn, continues clockwise around the table, then concludes with the environment turn. Each villain has various advantages, such as starting with certain cards in play, as specified by the villain character card. Play continues until the heroes reduce the villain to 0 or fewer HP, or until the villain defeats the heroes, either via a win condition or by reducing all the heroes to 0 or fewer HP.</description>

<description>Haven Town is facing total annihilation at the hands (and teeth) of a horde of monsters from beyond the Shadowrift.You the heroes must band together to drive them back. To do this, you will need powerful spells, skills, attacks and loot. When the game begins, you are a basic hero; you can explore and fight. Lucky for you, this is a deckbuilding game! You can buy new cards to add to your deck - cards which will define you as an adventurer and complement the strengths of your fellow heroes.Unlike other deckbuilders, there is constant interaction with your fellow players, as you figure out who will gain which benefit from the limited supply of townsfolk, offer your coin to help construct walls, and seek healing from anyone who's learned such magic.Shadowrift also features monsters that do not merely sit in play waiting to be slain - If you leave them alone they will rip Haven Town asunder. They'll kill people, break walls, and kick your heroes in the face. Combat with them is intuitive (though frequently painful).For defeating a monster, heroes gain Heroism, a simple, consistent boost to their power that makes them better at anything they undertake. Since the monsters won't stop coming until the last Shadowrift is sealed or the town has been built into a mighty fortress, you'll need every boost you can take.</description>

For defeating a monster, heroes gain Heroism, a simple, consistent boost to their power that makes them better at anything they undertake. Since the monsters won't stop coming until the last Shadowrift is sealed or the town has been built into a mighty fortress, you'll need every boost you can take.The second edition of Shadowrift features many improved mechanisms, including a revised system for how monsters choose who to attack (based on types of villagers, instead of specific people) and a new system for monster powers (making them much more dangerous). It also has a revised card layout and a great deal of new and improved artwork.</description>

<description>Eve of the Sickle Moon is an expansion to the heroic adventure game Shadowrift, a cooperative deck-building game in which the players are heroes defending a town against a horde of monsters in a high-stakes fantasy siege. This expansion adds two new monster factions:• The Lycanthrope faction consists of were-animals in many shapes and sizes. They all bear the common theme that they're able to bite villagers and spread their curse, and that when the full moon rises they become more powerful.• The Harrowood faction is a forest that has been twisted into a violent hatred of humanity by the opening of the Shadowrifts. They can create Overgrowths, which empower their faction and speed the town's destruction.To fight back against these foes, the heroes have four new hero cards with druidic power and four new hero cards with Elementalist powers. Three new villagers and a Wall are also included.</description>

<description>When Dark Stone was first discovered in the area around Brimstone, outsiders flooded in, looking to get rich! Now, they come looking to make a name for themselves (and maybe get rich along the way too). Though many of those that arrive are true Heroes in their own right, most are common folk with dollars in their eyes, blinding them to the horrors that await. Hiring themselves out as Henchmen, they join up with posses heading down into the dark mines. The flood of fortune seekers and merchants have also brought with them supplies and Pack Mules to carry the load, Blacksmiths to support the effort and forge the ‘black rock’, and Faithful Dog companions to help in hunting through the dark places of the world.</description>

Forming an adventuring posse, the Heroes venture down into the dark mines, overrun with all manner of ancient demons and foul creatures from another world. With tactical gameplay, lots of dice, and a robust card-driven exploration system, no two games are ever the same as the heroes explore the mines finding new enemies to fight, new loot to collect, and new dangers to overcome. Players can even find portals to other worlds, stepping through to continue their adventures on the other side!An exciting campaign system allows the players to visit local frontier towns between adventures, spending their hard-earned loot and building their characters from game to game! As players find fantastic gear and artifacts to equip their heroes, they also gain experience from their adventures. This experience is used to level up, guiding the hero's path through an expansive, class-specific upgrade tree of new skills and abilities, allowing each player to develop their hero to fit their own play style.In City of the Ancients, players will encounter portals to the otherworld on the Plains of Targa, finding an ancient frozen city whose living inhabitants are nowhere to be found. Instead, great mechanical keepers wander the city going about their duties - until interrupted by the arrival of the players' characters!So load up yer' six shooter, throw on yer' hat and poncho, and gather the posse as the darkness is coming, and all hell's about to break loose...in theShadows of Brimstone!Can be used together withShadows of Brimstone: Swamps of Deathto raise the maximum players to 6.</description>

<description>Flesh Stalkers are a mysterious, rare, and ancient alien race. Masters of super science and the macabre, they work in the shadows, only emerging when required to accomplish their fiendish goals! Known for the ruthless and gruesome experiments they perform, the Flesh Stalkers splice the DNA and body parts of various creatures and people together, creating hideous monstrosities to do their bidding. Of all their wretched constructs, the most numerous are the Flesh Drones; mindless automatons cobbled together from the hapless souls stolen in the night by the Stalker, mixed with metal and madness to form the perfect hive of worker drones. When not in use, they are stored, dormant, on rows of hooks, hanging from the ceiling by the crude handles attached to their backs...waiting to be activated for the next call to harvest new bio-material and bodies.</description>

<description>On the war-torn, industrial-age battlefields of Trederra, legions of alien soldiers patrol the ruins of their once great cities, searching for anyone foolhardy enough to intrude into their territory. Waging war on each other for generations, the battle-scarred Nations of Trederra use Dark Stone to fuel their engines of death, polluting their planet with radiation and drifting clouds of toxic gas. But there are also treasures to be found amidst the devastation, weapons and technology advanced beyond reckoning by brutal centuries of warfare.</description>

<description>Outlaws are a common occurrence through the region around the ruins of Brimstone. Even before the town blew and the portals began to open, the gold rush and Dark Stone rush that grew the town out of control also lured in Outlaws and bandits by the thousands. Once the devastation occurred and the Darkness came, countless numbers of those Outlaws fell into shadow. Some became Mutants, other fell to the curse of the Lycan or began dabbling into dark Magiks, and many more began to rise from the grave as Undead. It wasn't long before the Undead Outlaws fell back into their old ways of robbing, rustling, and mayhem. Perhaps it was just faint memories of their old lives seeping back in, or maybe they have a cold purpose, with a mind for revenge on the land of the living.</description>

<description>Shadows of Maliceis a cooperative game in which 2-8 players work to unseal hidden Wells of Light to prevent the shadow demon Xulthûl from gaining a physical form and overrunning the Realm of Aethos.The Wells are located in strongholds scattered throughout the Realm and defended by powerful Guardians. Over the centuries, many of the Wells have fallen Dark, but if the players can find and unseal the remaining Light Wells they prevent Xulthûl from gaining substance and win the game. If Xulthûl’s Shadows, however, manage to defile a single Light Well, the demon will gain a body and enter the Realm. If this happens, the players must defeat Xulthûl in battle to save the Realm.Players control avatars, heroic champions imbued with unique masteries over Light. Each turn, the players move through the Realm, confronting their fate, battling creatures with deadly abilities, and engaging the services of cities and mystics in order to gather the potions, treasure, and soulshards they will need to defeat the stronghold Guardians and unseal the Wells they protect. The Light or Dark nature of each Well is revealed only when its Guardian is defeated.Meanwhile, Xulthûl’s Shadows are thickening in the Shadow Realm and will enter the game at random times in random locations, seeking the one Well that will bring about the entrance of their master.</description>

<description>Shadows over Camelot is a cooperative/semi-cooperative hand management and deduction-based board game for 3-7 players.Each player represents a knight of the Round Table and they must collaborate to overcome a number of quests - ranging from defeating the Black Knight to the search for the Holy Grail. Completed Quests place white swords on the Round Table; failed Quests add black swords and/or siege engines around Camelot. The knights are trying to build a majority of white swords on the Table before Camelot falls.On each knights' turn they take a 'heroic action', moving to a new Quest, building their hand or playing cards to advance the forces of good. However, they must also choose one of three evil actions, each of which will bring Camelot closer to defeat.Moreover, one of the knights may be a Traitor - pretending to be a loyal member of the party but secretly hindering their fellows in subtle ways, biding their time, waiting to strike at the worst possible moment...But enough words... Don your cloak, climb astride your warhorse and gallop into the Shadows to join us in Camelot!</description>

<description>Sherlock is a children’s memory style card game, with one card showing Sherlock and 49 cards showing an image, an arrow, and a number from 1-4. Players lay eight of the 49 cards face-up in a circle, with the draw pile in the middle. Before beginning the game, players take some time to memorize the images on the cards in the circle, after which all the clue cards are turned over.At the beginning of a player's turn, s/he places the Sherlock card next to a card, then names the object on the card Sherlock is next to and turns the card over to check. If s/he is correct, s/he moves around the circle, in the direction of the arrow, the number of spaces specified by the number on the card. S/he then guesses the object on that next card; if s/he is incorrect, all the cards are turned over again for the next player. If s/he is correct, however, s/he continues moving the Sherlock card around the circle in the same fashion. If the Sherlock card lands at a card that is already face up, the player takes that card and her/his turn is over. A new card is turned over from the draw pile, everyone takes a moment to memorize it, all cards in the circle are turned over, and play resumes with the next player beginning their turn.The first player to collect 6 cards wins.</description>

<description>Sherlock is a cooperative memory game in which players try to unmask the culprit by collecting cards that exonerate the remaining suspects.To set up the game, thirty cards are shuffled and placed face-down in a 6x5 grid. Each card shows one of six witnesses on its back and a witness viewing one of the five suspects on its front. On a turn, the active player reveals two cards in the grid. If they match, the player then turns over a third card. If all three cards show show the same suspect, the cardsa re collected and placed face-up next to the grid. In all other cases, that player turns the cards face-down once again, then flips over one of the ten timing cards, each showing Sherlock's nemesis Moriarty.If all ten Moriarty cards are flipped, then the players lose the game. If, however, the players remove cards from the grid until only three remain, they have successfully identified the culprit – that is, the suspect who remains – and can claim victory.A competitive variant is included in the rules which have players competing to collect witness cards. An additional variant rewards points to the player who holds (or doesn't hold) the suspect eventually identified as the culprit.The Sherlock box also includes eight bonus cards, a new dinosaur and action cards for a fifth player for Ilopeli's Jurassik.</description>

<description>Note: This game is in French, but BoardGameGeek rated the game is language independent and English rules can be foundhere.At 23:40 on April 14, 1912 in the North Atlantic, the R.M.S. Titanic strikes an iceberg. Water immediately floods into the liner's compartments and the ship is listing to starboard in a worrying way. There is no hope about the outcome. On board, there is widespread panic.Alone, or co-operating with other crew members, you must show presence of mind and do the right thing to save as many passengers as possible. Time is short...The card game SOS Titanic uses a mechanism similar to Patience, with the cards representing passengers who must be arranged on the decks, then placed in the lifeboats in a particular order. As one of the crew members, you and your teammates need to move and arrange these passengers as quickly as you can. Each section of the Titanic holds a pile of cards of which only the first is available.</description>

<description>Long before the threat of theNemesis, before the perils of warp drive or the founding of our ownSpace Academy, humanity experienced a Golden Age of space exploration. The mineral riches of the thriving Moon colony inspired legions of hearty Earth citizens to seek their fortunes in space. Humble rockets probed the farthest reaches of the solar system in an eager quest for resources, and brave colonists forged homes wherever they could survive. Pioneer life was hard, but the men and women who worked and raised their families on those planets and asteroids had much to be proud of.Then the rumors began — whispered tales of frontier abductions and sightings of mysterious creatures. By the time the secret invasion was exposed, the aliens were everywhere. Families had been stolen away by slavers from the stars, and the peace-loving survivors had no choice but to arm themselves and fight. Fight to stop the alien attacks! Fight to free the helpless abductees! Fight to throw the aggressors back into space and end forever their power to threaten humanity!Thus was born theRocket Patrol– an organization of brave and hearty women and men dedicated to defending humanity and taking the fight to the alien menace from the stars.Space Cadets: Away Missionsis a cooperative, scenario-based, tactical action game for 1-6 players, which is set in the Golden Age of science fiction. In this game, the third standalone title in theSpace Cadetsfranchise of cooperative/team space-themed games from Stronghold Games, players take on the roles of adventurous human spacemen who explore UFOs, acquire Alien technology and fight hostile extraterrestrials.Each turn, spacemen have three action points to spend on activities such as firing their atomic rifles, analyzing exotic equipment, or subduing the malicious Brain-in-a-Jar. When the spacemen are finished, the aliens take their turns by following simple movement and combat protocols; seven types of hostile aliens threaten the players, from the repulsive mind leeches to the rampaging titanic sentinels.Space Cadets: Away Missionscontains twenty scenarios linked in a campaign story. Each mission features different combinations of aliens on different spaceships, with hexagonal map tiles arranged to form flying saucers, rocket ships, space stations, etc. Cooperation, tactical planning and good dice are essential if the spacemen hope to overcome the relentless horde of little green men.</description>

<description>A cooperative game where the players attempt to clean out an infestation of hostile aliens from a derelict spaceship. Set in the Warhammer 40,000 universe, players take on the roles of Space Marines pitted against hordes of Genestealers.Players choose from six different combat teams, each consisting of two Space Marines with different abilities. Each player receives three Action cards for each of his combat teams. After all of the Space Marines have fallen into formation, prepare for the first wave of Genestealers.Game play is quick and easy to learn. Each game is played over a series of rounds, broken up into phases. During the Choose Actions Phase, each player must secretly determine which of the following Action cards they wish to play on their Space Marines: Support, Attack, or Move + Activate. You can't pick the same Action card next round, so choose wisely.Action resolution keeps all players involved while the overwhelming odds inspire them to work together to survive. The Action Resolution Phase consists of each player revealing and carrying out their chosen Action. The lowest number card goes first, which means Attacks are resolved after Supports. Support tokens enable Space Marines to re-roll, so make sure to cover your fellow Blood Angels.The Genestealer Attack Phase happens after all the Actions have been resolved, so hopefully you thinned out the swarms since you have to roll higher than the number of Genestealers in the swarm to successfully defend. Finally, an Event card is drawn to spawn more alien adversaries. Once all the Genestealers have emerged from the darkness, its time to move forward, drawing a new location card. And then it's back into the fight!</description>

<description>Space Moversis a cooperative sci-fi adventure set in the year 2201. In this game you play the role of one of the crew members on board the space ship Liberty. Your job as a Mover is to jump from planet to planet in the system picking up and delivering cargo. Movers specialize in getting cargo to its destination as efficiently as possible. As you deliver cargo, you are rewarded with resources that are needed to keep the Liberty flying. But you must do this without drawing too much attention from the Universal Oversight.Universal Oversight (UO) is the government elected by the planets to police the system. The UO watches all movement through the system in an attempt to keep order. Over time it has become corrupt and evil. UO Scouts are sometimes dispatched to chase down and interrogate Movers that have been spotted delivering cargo. They are looking to confiscate anything that might be a threat to the UO’s power. If you draw the eye of the UO too often, your job will eventually become impossible. You and your fellow players must work together to deliver cargo, avoid UO Scouts and quickly handle any Events that pop up along the way.To win the game, you need to complete a set of five Objective Cards. These cards directly continue the story that begins in the included graphic novel Finding Liberty. (A 20-card random objective card deck will also be included with the game. Players can choose 5 cards from this deck for a fresh experience each game)- Unique Dice-Rolling MechanicHow the dice are rolled-Space Movers handles dice-rolling to complete skill checks in a whole new way. Rolls take place inside the game box on a specially designed roll board. Dice are rolled one at a time instead of all at once. For each skill needed in the check, 1 die will be rolled needing a 5 or higher for success. Since the dice are rolled 1 at a time into the box, players are encouraged to strike dice already rolled in an attempt to change the result as needed. After all the dice are rolled, one last roll is made using the blank 6 sided die. This signals the end of the skill check and is a player’s last attempt to change any previous die results.- Comic Book IncludedThe story begins in the Comic book “Finding Liberty” that will be included with the game. Objective cards that match the Comic continue the story as you play the game.- Game SoundtrackListen to the official game soundtrack on your computer or smart phone.</description>

<description>The story thus far...The life of a Strategic Space Sheep Commander isn't easy, especially if that Commander is assigned to the Lambda Sector. Centuries of peace had lasted throughout Lambda, the various Sheep Systems have settled their remaining differences, and the sector has seen a golden age of prosperity and scientific advancement. With the era of scientific enlightenment came the creation of the Spatial Sheep Distortion Drive, supplanting the now-outdated Warp Drive. The ships outfitted with such operate both independently and synchronously with System bases to enable the crossing of vast distances in relatively short amounts of time. With this, the races of the Systems were brought even closer together. Commerce and cultural trade were at an all-time high, and families allowed their Sheeplings to roam free across the neighboring regions without fear.All was well in the galaxy – until the first messenger ship arrived from a force that has become known only as "Wolf". Its language was unintelligible, but its message was clear: complete and total annihilation of Sheepkind. Soon after, the first Wolf ships arrived, laying waste to the satellite planets of the Sheep Home Systems. Front-line galactic defense forces were able to stave off further destruction – but what is coming is far, far more terrifying than any threat faced in the galaxy's known history.All Systems have been placed under Red Alert, with the Strategic Sheep Command called together and a Flock Commander named. As members of Wolf have been spotted in Sheep Commanders' uniform, SSC has determined that the best way of insulating the individual Systems is by outlawing all usage of the Spatial Sheep Distortion drives. Inter-system access is granted only to the Elite "Shepherd" class ships, via a complex network of Hyperspace travel. A fleet of these specialized ships has been assigned to recover the Sheeplings and return them to their Home Systems while the Wolf invasion is repelled.You are a Sheep.You are a Defender in the Strategic Sheep Command.You have trained all of your career for this moment in history.You will issue Tactics to the Shepherd Fleet to direct the Rescue Mission.You know how to defeat Wolf – "Ewe's The Force..."Space Sheep! is a real-time, customizable, cooperative game – with possible traitor(s) in your midst – for 1-8 players. The Defenders want to get the Space Sheep tokens and Shepherd tokens back to their matching Systems before all the cards are gone and time has run out. (If playing with Infiltrators, thus making the game semi-cooperative, each player receives a secret allegiance card; each player knows only her own allegiance, leaving her to guess and decipher who else is on her team.)In Space Sheep!, on each player's turn, the player will play a card from her hand, allowing her to:Additionally, a player may play a card matching the System occupied by the Wolf to attack (and knock the Wolf token on its side).In Space Sheep!, one player acts as the Supreme Flock Commander, managing the one-minute sand timer. If the sand runs out, Wolf attacks and players must discard cards from the Defense Mat, the deck, or their hands; if they can't, they lose the game. If the Wolf token has been knocked on its side, the Supreme Flock Commander may flip the sand timer before it runs out to avoid the Wolf attack, standing up the Wolf token and moving it to another System in the process.Players who are Infiltrators will, of course, be attempting to delay action, make poor moves, and subtly manipulate the other players into making poor choices of their own. At any time players may point at one another in an accusatory fashion. If more than half the players simultaneously point at one player, this player is out of the game. He then reveals his Allegiance and:If players have found an Infiltrator, shuffle the player's cards in hand and place them on the bottom of the deck.If players have found a Defender, place the player's cards in hand on the face-down discard pile. On the ousted player's turn, Wolf attacks.If the Defenders get all shepherds and space sheep to their matching systems, then they win the game. If the sand timer runs out and players can't discard enough cards – or if the number of Infiltrators matches the number of Defenders in the game – then the Infiltrators win.</description>

<description>In the most distant reaches of the world, magic still exists, embodied by spirits of the land, of the sky, and of every natural thing. As the great powers of Europe stretch their colonial empires further and further, they will inevitably lay claim to a place where spirits still hold power - and when they do, the land itself will fight back alongside the islanders who live there.</description>

<description>Note: Includes Wrecktar, Sprawlopolis: Construction Zones and Points of InterestANDBeaches expansionsJackhammers chattering, trucks beeping, engines roaring, the sounds of construction are everywhere. Sprawlopolis is growing and YOU are in charge of it all. The last team of planners couldn't cut it, so the city turned to your team, the best of the best. If anyone can turn this tiny town into a thriving civic center it's you.In Sprawlopolis, 1-4 players work together to build a new city from the ground up. Using only 18 cards and a variable scoring system, the game is never the same twice. Each turn, players will play 1 card from their hand to the growing city, trying to score as many points as possible. Players will have to communicate and plan without revealing their own cards in order to most efficiently develop large areas in each of the 4 zone types. Watch out though, the city hates paying for road maintenance so each road will cost you points in the end. When all cards have been placed, the game ends and players see if they have met dynamically generated minimum score for their game. Can you meet the demands of the officials, work with your fellow planners and build the ultimate urban wonder? It’s time to find out!—description from the publisher</description>

<description>A group of archeologists has mysteriously disappeared during an expedition to the risen island of R'lyeh. You are a member of a rescue team sent to aid them, but as you investigate the site, you encounter something terrible that seeks to destroy your team from within...You'll need intuition, nerves of steel, and clever acting if you're going to survive and win the game. Who will believe you? Who is whom, and who is what? You can't trust anyone and no one will trust you, so block the doors, quarantine a suspect, reveal your identity to your "allies", grab a flamethrower, or run away — but look carefully where you will end up because "The Thing" might be closer than you think...InStay Away!, 4-12 players try to track down "The Thing", a creature  awakened from a nauseating eternal slumber on the emerged R'lyeh island that has the capability of possessing the human body, cloning it, then taking its place, so as you play you won't know who "The Thing" is or when someone will become "The Thing" or who is infected or not. The archaeologists are looking for The Thing; their goal is to work together to identify which player is The Thing and roast it with a "Flamethrower" card. You remain Human until The Thing passes an "Infected!" card to you during a card exchange, at which point you become an Infected and take on that new Role: You are now an ally of The Thing and must take care that its identity is not revealed.</description>

<description>"The six-man international crew has just dimmed the lights, bid each other a multi-lingual good night, and settled back to dream of gravity on board the International Space Station when the unthinkable happens. Siren blare, airlocks slam shut, emergency lights flash and it quickly dawns on the crew (not an IQ under 120 among'em) that something has gone horribly wrong. They quickly realize that the whole station is losing oxygen and that it isn't going to be long before they're all so much unrecoverable salvage.""The space station is a disaster. Equipment is strewn about after years of neglect. Nobody knows what to do. But then it dawns on them (sharp lads they are) - there is only one escape pod and six of them. It doesn't take an astrophysicist with a PhD from M.I.T. to figure out that only two of them are going home, and the rest are going to end up Sucking Vacuum.""Sucking Vacuum is an easy to learn, fast action strategy game for 3 to 6 players. Players assume the role of the doomed astronauts searching for equipment and struggling to escape the doomed space station. They must make their way through a randomly assembled map of the International Space Station while fighting off attacks of other players who are trying to escape themselves."Sucking Vacuum 2nd Edition (titled Ultimate Sucking Vacuum) is an updated version of the Origins Award-nominated game. Now in full color with a sturdy box, the game features new artwork on the 18 map tiles and 73 die-cut counters.Gameplay is similar to the original, but the rules have been re-written and revised in a number of areas. Additionally, the game now includes Tournament Rules and the Alien Incursion variant which has been extremely popular at conventions.</description>

<description>Sumoku is a crossword-style game with colored number tiles that can be played five different ways. In all Sumoku games, game play starts with the roll of a die to create a "key number" – either 3, 4 or 5. The digits in all groups of tiles placed in rows and columns must sum to a multiple of this key number. A tile is one of six colors, and a color cannot be repeated in a connected set of tiles.</description>

<description> Princess Emerald and her companions are questing deep into the Lordship Ruins to confront the evil that resides there. Brooding from his darkened hallways, the Forgotten King is a cursed lord who has pledged himself to the service of the Dark Consul, darkening his once lush and verdant lands. At his side are two new mini-bosses: Trent, a towering guardian of the forest with thick bark and brambles for armor, and Boris, a raging brute with snarling ursine features.InSuper Dungeon Explore: Forgotten King, players explore the Fae Wood, home of the Kodama, sentient forest spirits with a taste for adventuring Heroes. Wisps lure Heroes into ensnaring traps as terrifying, man-eating plants sprout from the loamy forest floor to devour them. Continue into the Lordship Ruins where the once proud bramble knights, now corrupted and twisted into servants of the Dark Consul, stalk the stony ruins for any who would defile their lord's holdfast. Don't get too close to the trees, though, as we hear the squirrels are in an ill mood.Super Dungeon Explore: Forgotten Kingincludes five new Heroes to brave the depths, including the Thundervale Huntress, Fae Alchemist, Tusk Tribe Shaman, and the brave Questing Knight. Each lend a new dynamic to gameplay and your strategy to conquer the Forgotten King and his minions.Forgotten Kingcontains two play modes: Classic Mode, in which someone controls the dungeon and its monsters while everyone else takes the roles of the plucky heroes, or Arcade Mode, which allows for a fully co-operative game for up to five players.Forgotten King, while itself a standalone game, is compatible with all previously publishedSuper Dungeon Exploreexpansions and supplements. One to five players take the role of classic fantasy heroes like the human paladin, a dwarf fighter, or an elf ranger. One player is the "Dark Consul" who controls the monsters of the dungeon. Every hero/monster has a character card that details the stats for movement, attack, armor, willpower, dexterity, action points and hearts (= life points). Additional information may include special abilities / actions / attacks and potions.The game is played on modular dungeon boards. During a round of play, the game passes back and forth between single heroes and the monsters, but the exact order may change from round to round. The characters use the stats from their character card, special dice (with hearts, potions and stars) are only used for combat and checks. If the heroes wound the opponent, they may draw loot cards to improve their stats. There is also the possibility to open treasure chests to find even more powerful things. The monsters have no possibility to "level up" apart from a single late game upgrade but the Dark Consul has an unlimited number of them.To win the game, the Dark Consul must defeat all heroes in his dungeon. The heroes must spawn the dungeon boss by killing monsters or destroying all spawning points (= entry points for new monsters). The heroes must then kill the dungeon boss to be victorious.</description>

<description>The mad Fire Elemental lord is out to burn down the dream forest. Attacking in waves using Fire Elementals, your only defense are trees and fountains and those animals brave enough to offer aid before scurrying away to safety. Using a unique drafting system and combining it with a tower defense game, will you be able to keep your forest green?Sylvionis a tower-defense type game in which attacks come down four rows and in waves. You build a deck using a unique drafting process and play cards from your hand by paying with other cards in your hand. You can play cards to the rows like fountains and trees or play animals for instant effects or to manipulate the enemy decks of cards. When all the waves have finished, you must have your marker on a green space to indicate that you have saved the forest; if you stand on a red space, then your precious forest has burned down.</description>

<description>TheT.I.M.EAgency protects humanity by preventing temporal faults and paradoxes from threatening the fabric of our universe. As temporal agents, you and your team will be sent into the bodies of beings from different worlds or realities to successfully complete the missions given to you. Failure is impossible, as you will be able to go back in time as many times as required.T.I.M.E Storiesis a narrative game, a game of "decksploration". Each player is free to give their character as deep a "role" as they want, in order to live through a story, as much in the game as around the table. But it's also a board game with rules which allow for reflection and optimization.At the beginning of the game, the players are at their home base and receive their mission briefing. The object is then to complete it in as few attempts as possible. The actions and movements of the players will use Temporal Units (TU), the quantity of which depend on the scenario and the amount of players. Each attempt is called a "run"; one run equals the use of all of the Temporal Units at the players' disposal. When the TU reach zero, the agents are recalled to the agency, and restart the scenario from the beginning, armed with their experience. The object of the game is to make the perfect run, while solving all of the puzzles and overcoming all of a scenario’s obstacles.The base box contains the entirety of theT.I.M.E Storiessystem and allows players to play all of the scenarios, the first of which — Asylum — is included. During a scenario, which consists of a deck of 120+ cards, each player explores cards, presented most often in the form of a panorama. Access to some cards require the possession of the proper item or items, while others present surprises, enemies, riddles, clues, and other dangers.You usually take possession of local hosts to navigate in a given environment, but who knows what you'll have to do to succeed? Roam a med-fan city, looking for the dungeon where the Syaan king is hiding? Survive in the Antarctic while enormous creatures lurk beneath the surface of the ice? Solve a puzzle in an early 20th century asylum? That is all possible, and you might even have to jump from one host to another, or play against your fellow agents from time to time...In the box, an insert allows players to "save" the game at any point, to play over multiple sessions, just like in a video game. This way, it's possible to pause your ongoing game by preserving the state of the receptacles, the remaining TU, the discovered clues, etc.T.I.M.E Storiesis a decksploring game in which each deck makes anything possible!</description>

<description>Each player represents a faction of a Human Alliance and manages one of their bases and its associated resources (money, units and cards). Players must deal with the alien offensive using their units to fight airborne and landed UFOs in an effort to strengthen their Alliance by getting countries to join them. In order to stop the Alien offensive and beat the invader, they must also investigate new technologies as well as the nature of the Alien life form.The Alien side is not controlled by any player. Its actions are determined randomly each turn, with an incremental difficulty as game progresses.-Basic mode is a cooperative game where 1-4 players form a Human Alliance that will fight to stop the alien invasion. In this game mode, if the Human Alliance achieves victory, all players win. Otherwise, everyone loses.-Advanced game mode, is a semi-competitive game for 2-4 players, where each player forming the human Alliance has his own secret agenda and is able to obtain individualized victory points. As in the basic mode, the total amount of victory points and human technology level will determine whether the Alien side has achieved victory. If Humans win, only one of the players will be declared winner, according to their fulfilled agenda and performance during the Alien War.</description>

<description>So far your first year at the Elementary College has been slightly disappointing. They taught you to light a flickering flame at the tip of your finger, but other than that you've spent much more time reading books than learning powerful spells as future great wizards like you should.So when you heard about the Big Book of Madness hidden in the great school library, you couldn't help but to sneak in and peek in this intriguing tome in spite of your professors' warnings. When you slowly lift the cover of the terrible book, dozens of dreadful creatures rush out, threatening to destroy the world itself! This was your mistake, and only you can fix it now! Learn from the library to fight back against the monsters, and try not to sink into insanity...The Big Book of Madnessis a challenging co-operative game in which the players are magic students who must act as a team to turn all the pages of the book, then shut it by defeating the terrible monsters they've just freed.Each player has their own element deck that they build during the game and use for several purposes, such as learning or casting a spell, adding a new element to their deck, destroy or healing a curse. Spells allow you to support your playmates, improve your deck, draw cards, etc. — but the monsters from the book fight back. Each comes with terrible curses that are triggered every turn unless you dispel them in time. They will make you discard elements, add madness cards to your deck, or lose spells...If you manage to turn six pages and defeat all of the monsters, you win the game!</description>

<description>Imagine that you are one of the crew in your favorite science fiction TV show. Now imagine that in the last 10 minutes of the show things have gone so badly that the captain is dead, and you and a member of your crew have to pull together and save the day yourselves!The Captain is Deadis a co-op game for 2 to 7 players. All you have to do is get the ship's engines (aka "Jump Core") back online and you win; but because there is a hostile alien ship trying to destroy you, that is easier said than done.You have an impressive star ship full of useful systems that will help you fend off the aliens, and get the Jump Core back online. Each system gives you an advantage while it remains online. The assault from the hostile alien ship tends to keep knocking those systems offline however. So you need to balance your time between keeping the ships system's online, fending off the alien threat, and completing your objective.Each member of your crew has special abilities and skills. You need to work as a group to maximize the potential of each role. If someone tries to be a hero, you'll all die.</description>

<description>You have escaped the hostile alien ship that killed the captain, for now. However, they have chased you into an asteroid field. The asteroid field has protected you from the aliens, but a rogue asteroid has knocked your Jump Core offline and left your ship to drift in space. Will you try to get the Jump Core back online, or simply try to drift through the asteroid field?This new mission will require a new strategy to win. The new alerts deck is full of all sorts of new atrocities to subject your crew to: It is more difficult than ever before.But it is not all doom and gloom. You and your crew have learned a few things since your last mission, and for that you'll receive new veteran abilities. Perhaps some of you will take on the role of Acting Captain while others might become a Sciengineer. In addition, there are a couple new battle plans that you failed to discover during the initial attack to make your job easier.</description>

<description>In The Crusoe Crew (a.k.a. Baiam or Kuala), you embody a character in an immersive story in which your choices guide your progress. You have a character sheet akin to those used in role-playing games that tracks your possessions, your special abilities, your coins, and your victory points. In general, gameplay consists in following the comic's panels — which contain clues, riddles and traps — and making choices about where to go and what to do, while using your visual perception to collect clues and be smart enough to resolve the riddles. As in any game, you can lose — sometimes really badly!</description>

<description>The Curse of the Black Diceis a pirate-themed dice game driven by a random mission generator and four possible mission types. The missions are generated by rolling a handful of black dice to determine the difficulty of each part of the mission. By rolling their own player dice and with the help from the pirate crew, the players try to get at least the same amount of dice to each mission part to fulfill this part. Each part grants rewards and penalties, and each mission has another endgame trigger condition: Each mission gives a reward if the crew fulfills it and punishment if they don't. What's more, if pirates don't fulfill the mission, they also risk that the next part of mission will be more difficult because of the curse of the black dice. In the end, only the player who has captured the most amount of gold wins — that is, if the ship doesn't sink and take all players to the bottom of the ocean with it.Sail together to find treasures, board ships, plunder villages, or even kill the mighty Kraken...and betray the other players when they don't expect it. There can be only one winner, but all players can lose together!</description>

<description>With new book decks Proven Guilty and White Night, you'll get even more variation in your options for play. As a pair of decks, these ones are particularly interesting in the Showdown, where you'll only get to spend Fate and roll for either Cases (in Proven Guilty) or Foes (in White Night). If you want to defeat your Foes or clear your Cases, you'll need to do so before you get to the respective Showdowns. And that's just the added challenge of the Showdowns for this deck — each one has its own new challenges, obstacles, and card interactions to give a different texture of play, as every scenario deck does.</description>

<description>Players inThe Gametry to discard all 98 cards in the deck onto four discard piles in order to win, but they need to do so in the right ways.Each player starts with 6-8 cards in hand depending on the number of players, and four discard pile prompt cards are on the table: two showing "1" and an up arrow and two showing "100" and a down arrow. On a turn, a player must discard at least two cards from hand onto one or more discard piles, with cards on the 1 piles being placed in ascending order and cards on the 100 piles being placed in descending order. One tricky aspect to play is that you can play a card exactly 10 higher/lower than the top card of a discard pile even when you would normally have to play in a descending/ascending order, e.g., if a 100 discard pile is topped with an 87, you can play any card lower than 87 or you can play the 97.After a player finishes their turn, they refill their hand from the deck. During play, players cannot reveal exact numbers in their hands, but they can warn others not to play on certain discard piles or otherwise make play suggestions.Once the deck is emptied, players are required only to play at least one card on a turn. If you play all 98 cards, you win! If you get good, the rules suggest that you play at least three cards a turn to increase the challenge.</description>

<description>Players inThe Gametry to discard all 98 cards in the deck onto four discard piles in order to win, but they need to do so in the right ways.Each player starts with 6-8 cards in hand depending on the number of players, and four discard pile prompt cards are on the table: two showing "1" and an up arrow and two showing "100" and a down arrow. On a turn, a player must discard at least two cards from hand onto one or more discard piles, with cards on the 1 piles being placed in ascending order and cards on the 100 piles being placed in descending order. One tricky aspect to play is that you can play a card exactly 10 higher/lower than the top card of a discard pile even when you would normally have to play in a descending/ascending order, e.g., if a 100 discard pile is topped with an 87, you can play any card lower than 87 or you can play the 97.After a player finishes their turn, they refill their hand from the deck. During play, players cannot reveal exact numbers in their hands, but they can warn others not to play on certain discard piles or otherwise make play suggestions.Once the deck is emptied, players are required only to play at least one card on a turn. If you play all 98 cards, you win! If you get good, the rules suggest that you play at least three cards a turn to increase the challenge.The German NSV edition ofThe Game on Fireis a special version ofThe Gamepackaged in a tin with a playmat and an "On Fire" mini-expansion. This expansion consists of six flaming cards (22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77) that replace the regular cards, and when one of these fire cards is played onto a pile, that card must be covered by the end of the next player's turn or else players have lost the game.The U.S. edition ofThe Game on Firewill have the six flaming cards in the box in place of the other cards, and it won't contain the playmat.</description>

<description>Translation of the Introduction to the French rulebook:"2nd August 1914 - In the main square of the village, a group of inseparable friends contemplate, incredulously, a General Mobilisation order, posted on the town hall. For several weeks, reading the news had become very worrying but the brutality of this announcement surprised everyone. Without having the slightest idea of the hell which they were about to be put in, they promised to stay together, to return whatever happened. Unfortunately, the reality that they were about to face would be completely beyond their worst fears.Like literature and film, gaming is a cultural medium. Undeniably participative. There is no subject that can't be covered. Some are more difficult to cope with than others. Particularly the life of The Hairies (Les Poilus). Guided by the deepest respect we hold for the suffering endured by these men, we have worked hard to design and set this game with this in mind. In this collective madness, we have chosen to put them in front of their concerns, their daily fears.The only way out for these men was their solidarity, their brotherhood, their ability to help themselves, to rescue one and all. Without ever addressing fighting, Les Poilus offers each player the chance to experience some of the difficulties experienced by the soldiers in the trenches. The atmosphere around the table will often not only be intense but emotional aswell. The path to victory will seem difficult but do not be discouraged. Press forward and experience the Great War!"[Please note I might have made a few errors, using and editing translation software results]</description>

<description>Note: Include Promo CardIn The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey Deck-Building Game, each player takes on the role of a member of The Company as they set out on the long and treacherous path to Lonely Mountain. Play as Bilbo Baggins, Gandalf the Grey, Thorin Oakenshield, or others. Your Hero card will guide your strategy throughout the game, or you can break away with a plan of your own.Each player starts with his own basic ten-card deck and draws a hand of five cards each turn. Power is the currency you will use to buy new, stronger cards to add to your deck. The goal of a deck-building game is to craft your personal deck into a well-oiled machine, and five types of cards can be acquired: Enemies, Allies, Artifacts, Maneuvers, and Locations. A large, central stack of cards supplies a five-card "Path" from which players make their purchases. Each player always has five face-up cards from which to choose each turn, so new options and surprises await each turn.When you have amassed enough Power, you can take on an Archenemy! Each Archenemy has Loot cards you can acquire. Defeat a Troll and you might find Sting, Orcrist, or Glamdring! Take on The Goblin King and you might find the maneuvers you need to escape from the Misty Mountains. Azog is the final Archenemy, and he has unfinished business...</description>

<description>The King's Armoryis a co-op tower defense game for 1-7 players that remains true to the online genre of tower defense; in addition, it allows new players to drop in or drop out of the game without destroying the game balance!Designed after our favorite online TD games, there is a map that consists of 16 road tiles that allows you to design your own new map each time. At the start of the game each player chooses one of seven playable heroes to lead the King’s defenses. The Heroes, though powerful, can not go it alone. They will need to build towers which will house hired aid, such as the Foot Soldier, the Archer, the Sorcerer, the Psionicist, and the Cleric; each with their own unique abilities. Over the course of the game Waves of monsters will flood onto the board, rushing down the path, turn by turn, trying to break into the King's Armory. If the monsters succeed, you lose! If you kill them all, including their leader, the super powered Boss monster, you all win together!To aid your quest you may upgrade your Heroes by purchasing unique Equipment that grants them newer better abilities; while the Hirables can be upgraded directly, up to 3 levels each, gaining new powers each time! And when all else fails, you can always call for Reinforcements; a set of special bonus attack cards that each deals damage to a whole area on the board in a new and unique way!</description>

<description>The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game is a cooperative adventure game in which the players attempt to complete a scenario, each with three heroes of their choice and a deck of allies, events and attachments to support them. Each round, players send their heroes and allies to quest or to fight with enemies that engage them. However, as the heroes and allies exhaust after questing, defending, or attacking, the players' options are typically insufficient to deal with everything at once. Therefore, players need to determine whether it is more urgent to quest and make progress in the scenario while the enemy forces gain power, or to take down enemies while making no progress, not knowing what will come next.The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game is the base game of a Living Card Game for which new adventure packs are released monthly. The base game contains three scenarios, twelve famous characters from the works of J.R.R. Tolkien (including Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Denethor and Eowyn), and four pre-constructed player decks. Players can either use one of these decks or construct their own deck to increase their chances to be succesful in the more challenging scenarios. The monthly adventure packs contain a new scenario, a new hero, and new player cards to be used in their deck. The base game is for 1-2 players, but with an additional base game the scenarios can be played with up to four players.Although this game is set in Tolkien's Middle Earth, the scenarios do not represent scenes from the books, but rather take place in the seventeen years from Bilbo's birthday until Frodo's departure from the Shire.</description>

<description> "Chief among their foes was the dread realm of Angmar and its sorcerer king."–J.R.R. Tolkien, The Return of the KingThe Battle of Carn Dûmis the fifth and penultimate Adventure Pack in the Angmar Awakened cycle forThe Lord of the Rings: The Card Game.Over the course of the Angmar Awakened cycle, the heroes of Middle-earth have become aware of an evil that threatens the North. Now, the time has come to strike. With its sixty new cards, The Battle of Carn Dûm introduces a challenging, combat-intensive scenario that takes your heroes into the heart of Angmar where you'll need to fight your way through hordes of Orcs and other creatures in order to prevent an ancient evil from returning to the world. However, if the walls of Carn Dûm and the raw might of the assembled Orcs and Werewolves aren't enough to slow you, you'll still need to deal with the dread Captain that leads them and the foul and shadowed Sorcery that fills the air.Nonetheless, your heroes and their courage are not to be underestimated. Along with its scenario,The Battle of Carn Dûmintroduces a new Dúnedain hero and twenty-seven player cards (three copies each of nine different cards), including powerful events for each Sphere of influence. These continue to round out the new mechanics explored within the cycle, as Leadership and Tactics players gain new Valour effects, Lore players gain an event that allows their Dúnedain or Rangers to avoid a scenario's deadliest enemies, and Spirit players gain a Noldor-themed card that plays only from the discard pile. With their new allies and these powerful events, your heroes just might stand a chance... </description>

<description> "It was at the beginning of the reign of Malvegil of Arthedain that evil came to Arnor. For at that time the realm of Angmar arose in the North beyond the Ettenmoors. Its lands lay on both sides of the Mountains, and there were gathered many evil men, and Orcs, and other fell creatures."–J.R.R. Tolkien, "The North-kingdom and the Dúnedain"For months, several of Middle-earth's greatest heroes have traveled with the Rangers of the North and fought alongside them in the hopes that they might safeguard the realm against a new and massing threat. Now, their adventures have led them to the fortress of Carn Dûm, the very source of the North kingdom's greatest evils. There, accompanied by a small army of Elves and the few remaining Dúnedain, they have fought through the outer guard and their captain, earning passage into the darkened hallways that lie ahead of them, but those hallways are eerily quiet, cold, and lonely in comparison to the battle raging outside…In the new scenario fromThe Dread Realm, your heroes must make their final push through the halls of Carn Dûm to prevent an ancient evil from returning to the world, but the halls that initially appear so cold and empty are full of terrible sorcery and other evils. The dead don't lie quiet in Angmar, and you'll need to battle past wraiths, witches, and possibly even those members of your fellowship who fall in battle only to be reanimated by the dark magic that pervades the fortress and its catacombs. </description>

<description>The Ravens of Thri Sahashriis a two-player cooperative card game. One player is playing the girl Ren who has lost her memory; the other is the detective trying to repair it. The game is about trying to communicate as well as possible by simply the choice of cards. (Note: "Thri Sahashri" is the buddhist term for a trillion worlds combined, which in this case means "the other plane".)Of a deck consisting of cards of five colors and numbered 1–5, the Ren player draws four cards and keeps them face down. The goal for both players is to ensure that when the hand ends, the playing field has cards of these colors and these colors only.Each round, the detective draws as many cards as he wishes from the shuffled deck, putting them on the playing field according to the marks on the cards. The deck also contains ravens, which when drawn will "eat" any discarded cards of that color and threaten to take them out of the game.When the detective player is done, the Ren player picks one of the cards in the playing field and puts on the leftmost still "incomplete" hidden card. A hidden card is complete when that card plus the cards placed on it total 7. (The fourth pile, however, should total only 5, according to the Japanese poem metric "dodoitsu" that goes 7-7-7-5.)Once all four hidden cards are completed, the round ends and unless the playing field has exactly the colors represented among the hidden cards, the players have failed. The game is played for three hands, but in the final hand, one hidden card must be completed per round, lest the players fail. Players also fail if the deck runs out or if all five Ravens are drawn.</description>

<description>This bundle includes:The Shipwreck Arcana (base game)The Shipwreck Arcana: Kickstarter 2017 promosThe Shipwreck Arcana: Stars Below ExpansionThe Shipwreck Arcana: the Imago Promo CardTrapped in a drowned world, you and your allies are doomed -- or are you? Using a mystical deck and a healthy dose of logic, you can predict each others' fates and escape unscathed.The Shipwreck Arcana is a compact, co-operative game of deduction, evaluation, and logic. Each player's doom constantly changes as they draw numbered fate tiles from the bag. By choosing which fate to give up and which card to play it on, you can give your allies enough information to identify the fate you're holding...which is important, as the active player cannot communicate with their allies during their turn!Each card has strict rules governing what fates can be played on it. As doom builds up, the cards themselves fade, becoming one-time powers to help the players while new cards cycle in from the deck.Skilled play requires carefully rationing powers, hints, and cycling, while paying attention to not only where each fate was played -- but more importantly, where it wasn't.The rotating active player creates a different group dynamic each turn, preventing any one player from dominating the game. Inexperienced players can still use the group deduction phase to ask questions (while they are not the active player).</description>

<description>The South shall rise, and the North will follow fast upon its heels. Two titans will battle for this Nation, and they will not be, as the President had hoped, the “better angels of our nature.” Death will walk the land and not one of us will know peace, not even in the grave. - Private John Picket, in a letter home, Taunton, MA, June, 1861.From designer John Welch comes your chance - with up to three additional friends to alter the course of a fractured United States, increasingly menaced by Confederate zombie soldiers (“Zebs”), and the dangerous Revenants and Glorious Dead that await you.Based on the alternate history of author S.M. Cross’ The South Shall Rise (pending publication), this is a game of tactical combat set during the American Civil War, where those within the Confederacy take a terrible risk to use the dead as reanimated soldiers. With four unique and challenging scenarios to choose from, crawl out of the trenches and rise to glory… or die (again) trying.Good luck... you’re going to need it!What's in the box:• One 36-page full-color Rules booklet• One 11” x 17” map• 20 standees• 45 counters• 25 cards• Five scenario cards• One player aid • Two six-sided dice• One 11” x 17” mounted, jigsaw-cut game map • One bright red, 9 1/4" x 5 7/8" Standard cardboard VPG game box• One beautiful box cover sleeve• One "Wipes-A-Lot" napkin• One charcoal desiccant packet</description>

<description>The Undercityputs a spin on the classic dungeon crawl adventure, setting it within the vast underground labyrinth of one of the Iron Kingdoms’ most famous cities.This board game for two to four players and comes with a seven-adventure campaign. The players play one to four characters from the Iron Kingdoms universe as they try to weed out a nefarious evil that has been lurking in the Undercity of Corvis.All players will be playing on the same team and the game requires no game master. The players work together defeating enemies, achieving objectives, and gaining experience that can be used to give new skills to their characters that can be used in subsequent adventures in the campaign.The game will come with almost 40 different miniatures with 16 different sculpts. The four heroes are Milo Boggs (the alchemist), Canice Gormleigh (the gun mage), Gardek Stonebrow (a trollkin warrior), and Pog (a gobber mechanic) that controls a light warjack named Doorstop.Each character has a starting stat sheet, but players can purchase character ability cards with XP gained from the adventure to enhance and customize their characters.Combat is based on rolling dice against opposing attributes. Players will be able to use feats and abilities to give boosts to these dice rolls, similar in many ways to other games based in the Iron Kingdoms.</description>

<description>Planned for release in Q4 2015 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the cult TV show, the co-operative gameThunderbirdswill feature the iconic Thunderbirds machines and a high octane world full of disasters for players to come to the rescue.Set in the year 2065, Thunderbirds follows the exploits of International Rescue: a secret organization committed to saving human life, secretly founded and funded by the millionaire Tracy family, with the motto: ‘Never give in, at any cost!’. International Rescue has a host of technologically advanced land-, sea-, air-, and space-rescue vehicles and equipment ready to launch at a moment’s notice.Racing to the rescue from a secret island base beneath the luxurious home of the Tracy family somewhere in the South Pacific Ocean, International Rescue defies government spies and criminals who want the secrets of their incredible machines for their own. To combat this threat, Lady Penelope, the Thunderbirds’ aristocratic English secret agent, and her chauffeur Parker lead a network of agents to uncover those behind the disasters caused by deliberate sabotage.A criminal mastermind known as “the Hood”, operating from a temple deep in the Malaysian jungle and in possession of strange powers, often engineers events to allow him to spy on the Thunderbird machines with the goal of selling their secrets to the highest bidder.The iconic Thunderbirds are designed by the Tracy family’s close friend “Brains” and are assigned to each of the five Tracy brothers:- Thunderbird 1, piloted by Scott Tracy – a hypersonic rocket plane used for fast response and rescue-zone reconnaissance, and as a mobile control base.- Thunderbird 2, piloted by Virgil Tracy – a supersonic, VTOL carrier which transports their major rescue equipment in detachable pods.- Thunderbird 3, piloted by Alan Tracy – a single-stage, vertically launched spacecraft- Thunderbird 4, piloted by Gordon Tracy – a utility submersible for underwater rescue, launched from Thunderbird 2- Thunderbird 5, manned by John Tracy – a space station in geostationary orbit that monitors calls for help from across Earth.Finally, Lady Penelope has the iconic FAB 1, driven by Parker – a pink, amphibious carThunderbirds is a cult 1960s British science-fiction television series, created by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson. It was produced using a combination of marionette puppetry and scale-model special effects, which was dubbed “Supermarionation”. Two series, totaling thirty-two 50-minute episodes, were produced, along with two films using the same techniques.Players will work together using Thunderbirds characters and vehicles to complete rescue missions and save the day. For instance, to help complete the ‘Attack of the Alligators’ mission card, players will try to assemble Thunderbird 4 and Virgil in North America. All the time, being mindful of the influence of The Hood.</description>

<description>For eons, Incubi (bad, negative dreams) and Sognae (happy, positive dreams) have dwelled in Equilibrion, opposed but complementary. As the king of this City, you must establish and maintain the delicate balance between those dreams: place them in the various districts, harness their power, and beware of the Chaos – fearsome entities that thrive on discord and hatred.Urbion is a solo/cooperative card game: You (and your partner) must work (together) against the game and claim all the cards from the City deck before the Dream deck runs out! Victory is achieved by balancing the twelve City cards: when the sum of all Dream cards played next to a City card is equal to zero, you may claim it. In order to prevail, you must play your Dream cards skillfully or discard them at the right moment to trigger helpful effects. And you will have to dodge the penalties of the Chaos cards...Two expansions are included with the basic game:"Arch-Squares and Metas" introduces more City cards, and a new type of Dream: the double-sided (positive and negative) Metas."The Books of Powers" gives more effects from which to choose when discarding a Dream card at the cost of starting the game with fewer Dream cards.</description>

<description>The dwarves hide in the shadows of the trees from the wandering light. The burning tea-light (adult player) moves through the dark forest and tries to find the small dwarves in their hiding places. If a dwarf is touched by the light, it is frozen and not allowed to move anymore. The other dwarves try to release it. To achieve this they must wait until the light has gone far enough so that one of them can join it in the shadow. All the dwarves try to unite under one tree while the candle tries to freeze the dwarves. Who will win, the light or the dwarves?Shadows in the Woods is a cooperative game for players 5 years and up. An adult player for games where children play is required, due to the open flame of the candle. An alternative version included in the rules is intended for players 7 years and up, and is quite a bit more challenging. The alternative version does not require an adult player, but does require adult supervision. (The light doesn't move.)Original description from the instructions.By altering the position and number of larger tree models, the game may lend itself to play by older children and adults. There are 2 editions of the game. The original uses a single folding board, the second has a modular board.</description>

<description> Survivor tier contains pawns instead of miniatures.Hope is fading as the dead drive out the living. There’s nowhere left to run, and all that’s left is survival. There is no rescue party waiting, no help from kind strangers...in the world of The Walking Dead, there is no sanctuary…The Walking Dead: No Sanctuary is a cooperative board game of desperate survival set in the world of the popular AMC television series. Designed by Adam and Brady Sadler (Warhammer Quest: The Adventure Card Game), No Sanctuary puts players in the roles of iconic survivors from The Walking Dead, working together against desperate odds as they navigate a variety of scenarios. Whether the survivors are scavenging for supplies, fighting off waves of the dead, or even standing toe-to-toe with the living, the group must find a way to work together even when its members’ interests may be at odds.No Sanctuary features a unique leadership mechanic in which players take turns assuming the role of the group’s leader. Each turn, the leader must choose the group’s approach by drawing two event cards and choosing one. Since players cannot discuss this decision, the pressure is on the leader, and the leader alone will pay the price if the group is unable to follow the approach for the turn. Make enough bad decisions, and the leader may have to relinquish his role and let the next survivor take charge of the group.Each survivor in No Sanctuary comes with a unique deck of cards to represent their special actions and abilities, as well as their flaws. This deck not only drives each survivor’s playstyle, but it also serves their health, so hand management is crucial to surviving each scenario. Equally important as staying alive, group morale is an essential part of the game. Many game effects will cause morale to drop, and if it reaches zero, the players lose the game. Maintaining the group’s tenuous psychological stability is just as important as staying alive!With its unique gameplay and innovative leadership mechanic, No Sanctuary offers players a deep and engaging way to experience their favorite episodes of The Walking Dead, and even explore beyond the show’s storylines!</description>

<description>Witnessis set in the world of Blake and Mortimer, a Belgian comic series started in the 1940s by writer/artist Edgar P. Jacobs. In the game, which is playable strictly by four players, you each represent one of four characters and your goal is to solve mysteries or crimes by sharing information with one another — but you are quite restricted in how you can share information!Witnessincludes 64 cases for you to solve, and each case starts with an explanatory scene or image or both that someone reads or shows to the group. Each player then looks in his personal casebook to find information available only to his character. Players randomly decide who shares information first and in which direction, e.g., player A might whisper information to player B while player C talks to player D. Next, B will share both his information and A's information to C while D talks to A.After two more rounds of the most inefficient crime-solving system ever created, players read the conclusion of the case, which might offer additional information or another visual, then they each individually answer three questions about the case, with the group scoring one point for each correct answer for a final score ranging from 0 to 12.</description>

<description>On entering the wizard's academy, the new apprentices swore a solemn vow to learn the ways of magic, protect the institution, and uphold its values. Unfortunately most of them have failed to learn any significant magic in their first year. Susie coasts by on her natural talents, Malkar would sooner sell his soul for power than read a book, Nyvetta has forgone that option along with opposable thumbs upon accidentally turning herself into a bear, Flitter is only here to steal magic items to sell on the black market, and Bramblethrone spends too long talking to trees to get anything done. As a group of students, they could not be worse.</description>

<description>In X-Code, all players play simultaneously to cooperatively crack an encrypted code against time. The game board is constructed like a number field. The goal is to place a set of three equal cards on each square, including # and *. At the beginning, each player starts with three cards. As soon as the hourglass is turned over, gameplay becomes fast-paced: Players can draw or discard cards. In order to win the game, however, an exchange of cards with their neighbors is indispensable. The cards may not be passed on freely, however. Each card shows an arrow that indicates whether the right or left neighbor can be traded with and they must be ready to return a suitable card. Jokers allow you to replace missing cards. Once a player has a set of three equal cards in hand, they can place it on the appropriate space, either cracking part of the code or earning extra time. Storing time cards allows you to turn the hourglass over and earn valuable seconds. If the code can be cracked so that all fields are filled with the appropriate cards, the players have won together and can compete in another level.</description>

<description>You are humanity's last hope.InXCOM: The Board Game, you and up to three friends assume the roles of the leaders of the elite, international organization known as XCOM. It is your job to defend humanity, quell the rising panic, and turn back the alien invasion.Where the world's militaries have failed to stand against the alien invaders, you must succeed. To do so, you must make strategic use of the resources available to you. You must launch Interceptors to shoot down alien UFOs, assign soldiers to key missions, research alien technology, and use that technology to defend your base — all while trying to keep the world from collapsing just long enough that you can coordinate one final mission to repel the invaders for good.One of the more notable aspects ofXCOM: The Board Gameis the way that it incorporates a free and innovative digital app into the core of its gameplay. This digital companion will be available both as a downloadable app and as an online tool.The app's primary function is to coordinate the escalating alien invasion, randomly selecting from one of five different invasion plans. Each invasion plan represents a general outline that the alien commanders will use to coordinate the arrival of new UFOs, plan strikes against your base, and respond to your successes or failures as it seeks to conquer Earth. The app manages all of these tasks and heightens the game's tension as it forces you to respond in real-time. Then, after you move quickly to coordinate your response, you engage the enemy in the untimed resolution phase and feed the results to the app. Based upon these results, the app launches the invasion's next strikes.Additionally, the app teaches you the rules, controls the information that your satellites provide you, and tracks the progress of your resistance efforts, even as it allows you to enjoy the game at any of three levels of difficulty: Easy, Normal, or Hard.The use of this app does more than simply streamline your play experience and track your turns in real-time; it also permits a uniquely dynamic turn structure. While the variety of game phases remains the same from round to round, the order in which you and your friends must play through them may change, as may the number of a given phase. As a result, while you'll want to know where UFOs appear before you deploy your Interceptors, the alien invaders may be able to disrupt your satellite intel and force you to deploy your Interceptors on patrol with limited or no knowledge of the UFOs current whereabouts. Similarly, you may be forced to think about the costs of resolving the world’s crises before you know how many troops you’ll need to commit to your base defense.The effect of the app is to immerse you deep into the dramatic tension at the core ofXCOM: The Board Game, and it ensures that the game presents a challenging and cooperative (or solo) experience like no other. Just like the XCOM department heads that you represent, you'll need to keep cool heads in order to prevail.Source: Publisher</description>

<description>It's eggactly high noon, and the chickens Zicke and Zacke have started a feather-trimming duel. Starting rump to rump, they flutter in opposite directions, but since they're running around the chicken yard in a circle, they will meet soon enough with loud clucking. Whoever manages to jump over the other adorns herself with a new tail feather — but the more the young chickens puff up their feathers, the slower they strut around. And the worms, who are skillful enough to flee time and again, also make for lots of stops during the race.</description>

<description>Zombicide is a collaborative game in which players take the role of a survivor – each with unique abilities – and harness both their skills and the power of teamwork against the hordes of unthinking undead! Zombies are predictable, stupid but deadly, controlled by simple rules and a deck of cards. Unfortunately for you, there are a LOT more zombies than you have bullets.Find weapons, kill zombies. The more zombies you kill, the more skilled you get; the more skilled you get, the more zombies appear. The only way out is zombicide!Play ten scenarios on different maps made from the included modular map tiles, download new scenarios from the designer's website, or create your own! </description>

<description>Season 2: Prison Outbreak takes the players to an indoor environment with vicious close-ranged fights, Prison Outbreak contains all the needed material for a new player to enter the Zombicide universe, and lots of content, almost all new, for an existing Zombicide player to expand his game experience. In fact, Prison Outbreak holds even more material than the core game published in 2012 (now nicknamed Season 1)!The Prison Outbreak will feature berserker zombies. They’re really tied to each other. Prison tiles display tortuous alleys, small rooms and doors everywhere, filled with berserker zombies immune to ranged weapons. You have to think fast, foresee the improbable and jump into melee at every turn. This is like a modern dungeon where levers are replaced with switches to open or lock doors, use security rooms and reach secret areas.Prison Outbreak also contains six new survivors with their Zombivor aspects. These survivors are really designed to act as a team, as their skills really complement each other. They’re precious assets to any Zombicide team.Missions featured in the rulebook form a campaign on their own, as survivors battle to turn a zombie-filled prison into a reliable shelter. Many challenges await them, but they have new tools of the trade: riot shields, automatic shotguns, concrete saws and many more toys. There’s even an alternate ending.Integrates with:ZombicideZombicide Season 3: Rue Morgue</description>

<description> Zombicide: Black Plague takes the zombie apocalypse into a fantastical medieval setting! The arcane powers of the Necromancers have unleashed a zombie invasion in the age of swords and sorcery, and it's up to your group of straggling survivors to not only stay alive during these dark times, but to take back the realm and punish those responsible for the apocalypse!Zombicide: Black Plague allows you take control of paladins, dwarves, knights, and magicians, wielding powerful swords, crossbows, and even magic spells to defeat the zombie hordes and its Necromancer overlords. The classic Zombicide rules have been revamped for this new incarnation of the game, while still retaining the nonstop action, tense atmosphere and easy-to-learn rules that made Zombicide a classic. Equip your survivor with equipment like chainmail armor or shields to defend against the undead, pick up spell books to perform fantastic enchantments, or light up a pool of dragon bile to create an all-consuming inferno of dragon fire!Take on the zombie invasion from the medieval streets to secret vaults that create quick passages through the citadel (and often hold special artifacts). Chase down the elusive Necromancers to keep them from multiplying the zombie masses. And tackle a whole new set of missions through which your group of survivors will become the heroes of the land (or the last victims of the zombie massacre). </description>

<description>In some places, dark magic seems to permeate the ground itself, corrupting everyone and everything. It can be the consequence of a necromancer ritual, a desecrated sanctuary, or the recent manifestation of otherworldly forces, among others. In such areas, infected animals gather like moths to a flame. Zombies are almost immortal. And above all, scourges like necromancer dragons may claim the place as their wicked nest. From then on, nature itself seems to succumb to the zombie plague, and all hope is lost. Until we show up, that is. As long as we have something to say, there will be no rest for the wicked!</description>

<description>Zpocalypseis a survival board game set in a post-apocalyptic wasteland. Two to four players start in a basement/fallout shelter which can lead out to several base locations or even through the tunnels to sewer grates throughout the transformable board. The survivors are trying to make it day to day in a world torn apart from the walking dead.As in any survival game, one needs food, guns, ammo, and more. Players go out into the wasteland and scavenge for supplies, or perhaps to find a new gun or melee weapon to fend off the next zombie attack. In addition to gathering supplies, each player forms and controls his own squad – and each squad works to fortify the bases. Your walls and barbed wire won’t hold the dead for long, however, and they’re getting hungry.Characters receive victory points for killing zombies, building defenses, and successfully completing goals. Victory points show who is soldiering on the best in this wasteland. The final tally of points determines the winner. Victory points also act as experience points for leveling up a character.The game combines combat, tactics, resource collecting, character development, team play, and strategy towards the goal of surviving in theZpocalypse!</description>
